Progress of Insight Part 1 (Anitya Dukkha Anatma)
======================================================
The 4 Foundations of Mindfulness
----------------------------------------
    1. **The first foundation - The Body (5 senses)** We closely observe all objects that enter experience through the sense doors of the body - Touch, Hearing, Vision, Smell, Taste. We deeply familiarize ourselves with what it means to be aware of these objects. How these objects are constructed. How they can be deconstructed. It is possible to pay attention to an entire sense door all at once or to zoom in on individual objects. It is possible to pay close attention to objects and to understand that they break down into constituents. It is possible to observe these objects so closely that all sense of familiarity with what they are is completely lost
    2. **The second foundation - Vedana** This is a kind of sorting that the mind does to the object - any object. The mind sorts whatever it can possibly experience into 3 buckets and places a sorting-tag on top of it - Positive/ Negative/ No idea. The only reason the sorting bucket of 'No idea' exists is because the mind hasn't decided yet or hasn't yet been pushed by circumstance into a decision. Any object/event in the mind has this sorting-tag layered on to it. Though it is a function of the mind, due to its close intimacy with the object, it can be 'considered' as a facet of 'sparsh' or 'phassa' or contact thus belonging to the object itself. But granted or gifted to it by the mind. It is through tracking and discerning vedana that chunking together of objects and the experience of chunked up compound objects can be seen. Any and every object can be deconstructed, similarly any and every object can be combined to create a compound object. The mind does this all the time. The experience of being in a movie theatre on an emotional roller coaster, a conversation with a loved one being very very lovey-dovey, just sitting here in this room with thoughts swirling around how sucky life is - These are compound objects each carrying its own vedana independent of its constituents. Each spooling off chains of DO - which is perhaps a topic for another discussion.
    3. **The third foundation - The mind** Thoughts, feelings, emotions, memories, attitudes, mental states - everything that is mind created. Whether in response to objects coming in through the 5 sense doors of the body or through habituated movements of the mind, these objects are constantly coming and going. To closely scrutinize what they are, to have the ability to discern the differences between them, to develop a deep familiarity with them is to establish mindfulness in this foundation.
    4. **The fourth foundation - Dharmas** Consider satipatthana through an analogy of playing pool. So one is playing pool, playing it quite well, enjoying it thoroughly but with an objective to experientially learn the mechanical behavior of pool balls. The 4th foundation. You want to learn Newton's laws of motion, about friction and momentum, about spins and collisions, basically all of classical mechanics - in 'action' ... experientially and not theoretically. In order to do this you have to first learn how to play pool, play all kinds of shots, learn how to optimally pocket balls including trick shots. Learn to make that table sing. The observed behavior of pool balls leads to an experiential understanding of classical mechanics, the fourth foundation of mindfulness - The dharmas. The ruleset that describe the behavior of pool balls colliding against each other on the table.To learn the dharmas, they have to arise through observing the other 3 foundations in isolation and in combinations and all together. The dharmas are an understanding of precedents and consequents of events and of relationships between events. The dharmas themselves are cognitive events and they happen within the mind. Thus they can also be targets for attention/awareness. As the dharmas arise you sink attention into them, holding them in smriti/sati/short term working memory so that they are 'learnt'. This is knowledge which over a period of time will become wisdom leading to dispassion. You play pool in order to observe and learn the principles of classical mechanics and you play the mindfulness game with the three foundations in order to observe and learn the dharmas. Sinking attention again and again into the dharmas we memorize those principles and let those principles transform all of our mental models regarding the self and the world and the interaction between the self and the world. This is the apple dropping from a tree and landing on the noggin of a genius who then groks something about how stuff works. Since time immemorial, there must have been thousands of apples and thousands of noggins but only one genius! ... In the absence of innate talent, regularly having apples dropping on our head again and again ... and again ... helps! Repetition yields results.

The Progress of Insight
----------------------------------------
As we learn to establish mindfulness in the four foundations, competency in engaging with these objects naturally increases and we are consistently learning relationships, rulesets, gaining knowledge about how stuff works. A common progression of these rulesets follows the pattern of Anitya-dukkha-Anatma. Everything is unreliable, therefore causes friction in the mind ranging from dissatisfaction to full blown panic, but the 'I' the hero of the story doesn't really exist in the way that I have always believed. The sense of self is more of a passenger in the driver's seat of a self driving car, an afterthought of impersonal mental processes, a convenient place holder to ascribe volition and responsibility, a post-it-note stuck on top of the most salient things that the mind is doing - constantly being ripped off and stuck somewhere else. Therefore **.... why ... so ... serious !!??** And then one particular pass through the knowledges of Anitya-Dukkha-Anatma ends. This lesson is learnt again and again - there would be multiple passes - until it is learnt at the deepest levels of the mind.

Awakening is the culmination of a deep learning of how stuff works, particularly the defilements or the sanyojanas, the mechanisms of how suffering is created. To gain knowledge of the defilements thereby gaining wisdom from them thereby gaining dispassion towards them till eventually they are extinguished. The defilements are like tiny fires each one of which requires passion towards them as a fuel. Dispassion means to gain the understanding that is required to look at them and say nope! no more! you are powerful, but you require my cooperation to survive and I hereby declare non violent civil disobedience. I will deny you the fuel that you need to burn. It is the act of turning into a donkey plonking itself down onto the middle of the road refusing to obey its master because it has had enough. Its an act of surrender and in that surrender lies conquest.

Awakening is not a 'state' it is not about being non-dual or non-local. It is not about being in some perpetual floaty state of pure awareness without a subject object relationship. It is not about being aware of the heart and being aware from the heart. It is not about being aware of the corner of the room and being aware from the corner of the room. These are highly constructed states, very beneficial, they develop shamatha and ekkagrata and as configurations of mental faculties, they afford learning opportunities in the way that they are created and in the way that they collapse. In that sense they can form part of the awakening curriculum. But awakening itself is the end result of a curriculum, it has nothing to do with these configurations. At its essence awakening is a learning that sinks into our bones and becomes a part of us. The kind of learning that not only transforms mental models (The manifestation of the fetters) but uproots the very mechanisms that created those mental models in the first place (The 10 fetters)

One particular way of structuring Satipatthana practice leads to a particular learning curriculum - what is called the PoI map and here is how it plays out:

    1. It begins with training awareness to fully engage with 'objects'
    2. Awareness initially engages with objects clumsily but as skills develop it starts to engage with objects fully, tracking them. This is the first time that awareness fully engages with 'zero', 'Shunya', nothing-ness. The mind groks that what ever it experiences has no inherent existence, it literally materializes out of nothing and goes back into nothing. This is the first time that the mind realizes that what it experiences as 'stuff' is really a creation of the mind itself. The mind doesn't care whether the stuff exists in the outside world, it has at this point in practice fully understood the fact that it never engages with the outside world, it always engages with its own representations, its own projections, its own constructions. It sees these constructions getting created and falling apart. As long as a creation exists it can be broken down till it becomes meaningless, and then reconstructed to have meaning return to it. This is the insight into emptiness or 'shunyata'. Its simple description is 'All experience is created by the mind, all meaning associated with experience is injected into it by the mind' The outside world is .. well .. outside the scope of the mind.
    3. As awareness becomes very very conversant in tracking objects from their inception to their demise, there is a shift in the 'target' of awareness. Awareness starts to engage with the underlying nature of objects, the fact that they change, the fact that they appear out of no where, shimmy and shake, do a little dance, and dive back into the nothing-ness that they emerge from. The object at this point is no longer the object of meditation, the mind is now meditating on the characteristic of change.
    4. But so what! things change! Big deal! I already knew that shit! If I sit in front of an anthill for an hour, I will see all the change that I ever need to see .... why am I not awakened .. yet! Why?
    5. This is the point at which pashyana or the process of seeing can take a yogi .... this point and not beyond
    6. The mind pulls a magnificent contortion at this point .... it starts to do 'vi' pashyana. A radically different way of seeing, so radical that we almost never know that the mind can do this unless we apply ourselves in meditation
    7. Awareness at this point radically reconfigures. Attention which can be considered simply as a presentation of awareness (responsible for a subject-object relationship) takes on a very important role. The arrow of attention which is always uni-directional pointed outwards in mindfulness meditation, inwards in self inquiry becomes bidirectional. The mind knows two things simultaneously. It 'knows' the object's nature and it knows its own nature .... at the same time
    8. Things change, yes, but the mind realizes that it seeks things that are 'nitya' or reliable and understands its own expectation and through close observation of impermanence realizes that everything, absolutely everything is 'anitya' or unreliable. Through meditation thus far, the mind has grokked that it is now engaging with the building blocks of everyday ordinary human experience, the unreliability or 'anityata' of a sound, a smell, a touch, an itch, a thought, a memory, an attitude is projected by the mind to encompass all of everyday 'life' experience. People are unreliable, relationships are unreliable, identities are unreliable, personal histories are unreliable, group memberships are unreliable, nationalities are unreliable, day and night are unreliable, lunch appointments are unreliable, romance is unreliable, the love of a parent for their child is unreliable, every fucking thing is unreliable
    9. These things aren't discursively known during the meditation. But they show up off the cushion and become the mythical 'Dark Night of the Soul' .... and the mind experiences a particularly strange kind of fear .. maybe for the first time. A fear which has no explanation, a fear associated not with an object but in fact associated with the mental model of reality that the mind carries within itself. At this point the mind is so deeply enmeshed in its mental model that this fear is understood as arising from the simple act of being alive, of being conscious, rather than coming about because of a big mean dog barking.
    10. Fear, misery, disgust .... these are the RGB of Dukkha. Like three dials which determine how dukkha presents itself to us as we go about our business. And each segues on to the other in meditation .... not automatically. The experience of fear has to become the knowledge of fear ..... the mind has to have been fully present, very very very mindful of how this fear actually arose, where did this fear come from ... then the mind has to let go of a very key aspect of itself, something so subtle that the only appropriate words ... don't even do it justice. Then and only then does fear move on to misery ... and so on and on till the dark night ends
    11. **Scripting warning:** The mind holds expectations from conscious experience ... 'we' hold expectations from the story line interpreted from conscious experience and therefore there is fear. The mind learns that holding expectations leads to fear. And its not about whether expectations are towards positive or negative outcomes ... if you hold an expectation .... you are fucked! I am writing this 'write-up' .... it will be read and appreciated ...... Fucked! I am writing this 'write-up' .... nobody will understand it ..... Fucked! My government will deal with the pandemic ..... fucked! my government will not deal with the pandemic ... fucked! I will be alive tomorrow.... fucked! I will probably be dead tomorrow .... fucked! Fucked! Fucked! Expect something good ... fucked! Expect something bad ... fucked!
    12. The mind learns to operate without expectations, and the mind gives up the very need to hold expectations from 'objects' ... we learn to give up expectations from the story of our lives and we simply give up the very underlying need to hold expectations from our lives
    13. We learn to give up expectations in order to be free of Fear, we learn to give up animosity and dislike in order to be free of misery, we learn to give up rejection in order to be free of disgust, and we learn to give up separation and cultivate intimacy in order to be free of the feeling of Get Me The Fuck Out Of Here!!!
    14. At the end of this process when the yogi emerges successfully out of the dukkha nanas having seen how dukkha comes about, and how it ceases, how the cessation of dukkha requires one to let go of 'Satkaya drishti', 'Kama Raag', 'Vyapad', Rupa raag, Arupa raag, Maan, and Avijja (Personality view, Lust, Adversarial-ness, passion for form, passion for the formless, pride / Self respect/ assertiveness, compulsion not to challenge mental models) .... The yogi isn't even a yogi .... He is no longer a father, a son, a husband, a citizen, a friend .... The very mechanism through which these roles get created are simply let go of .... there is no choice ..... The mind rejoices ..... All of reality is simultaneously projected on the screen ... Its a visual screen, an olfactory screen, a tactile screen, a conceptual scree, an emotional screen, a formed screen, a formless screen .... The whole screen is simply dumped!!! Gone ... Gone for ever .... well .... not for ever ... but poetic license?
    15. And it happens many times ..... 'Gate' 'gate' 'gate' 'gate' .... and some more 'gate' .... until finally ..... 'paragate' ... 'parasamgate' ..... Bodhi! ...... guns blazing Svaha!
    16. This entire process gives you a detailed tour of the Dharma ... you don't need the words, the conceptual scaffolding on which the Dharma hangs ..... But what happens is what is represented by those words which are wrapped around metaphorical concepts ... And you realize the meaninglessness, the shunyata of the 'Dharma' itself
    17. The raft can be let go of.

Part 2 of this post will deal with:

    1. Strategies for flipping the script to Anatma first thereby making the journey a bit more impersonal, a bit more bearable
    2. Exercises that impart techniques to learn from the dukkha nanas - the part under the 'scripting warning'

Thank you for reading this. Any and every comment is welcome. Those that come from 'direct experience' would be met with absolute delight ... and would also perhaps be the ones carrying value for others.
