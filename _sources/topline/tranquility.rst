The deliberate cultivation of tranquility 
====================================================

Introduction
------------------

During a period of time when I needed a lot of tranquility in my mind, I worked with a structured rule-set to cultivate this tranquility. This post describes the rule-set. As rule-sets in meditation practices go, one very quickly discovers that the rule-set itself is actually a toy that one gives to the intellect to play with so that it more or less cooperates with the pre-conceptual mind. In that sense the rule-set is important but in my experience once the pre-conceptual mind learns the raw mechanics of what lies underneath the concepts and language, the rule-set can simply be set aside.

What follows is a step by step process of training the factors of awakening culminating in a great degree of emphasis on the factor of tranquility. The idea is to get good at this and then move on to either absorption/jhana practice or insight practices of investigation of individual or collective sense doors. The steps involved explain what to do and the factor / skill you are supposed to work on in order to layer on to the factor that you have already developed in any previous step. I have basically used the terminology of meditation practice in a particular way that makes the most sense to me. Not in order to contradict or debate any body else's definitions but simply in the service of the objective of the practice.

I have written this post in the voice of an instructor simply because its an easier writing style. I am not a teacher and I don't fancy myself to be an expert.
Preliminary:

We need to get a feel of using smriti/sati/mindfulness/short term working memory in a prosaic setting. Think of a 4 digit number clearly distinctly, think about it once and try and hold it in your mind. Don't commit it to memory! You cannot chant it to yourself, you cannot visualize the number on a white board. Just sit doing nothing for a while. with the intention to hold it in your mind. Remember ... you cant chant it / verbalize it .... you cant visualize it. Can you recall the number in 30 seconds? Can you recall it in 45 seconds? Can you recall it in one minute? Whether you can or cannot is not the point! Do not get frustrated! The attempt you made engaged short term working memory. The work bench of the mind. Try the same exercise using random sentences from a magazine or newspaper, or the image of a random person in print or TV. The more familiar you get with this exercise the greater the 'feel' you will have of bringing 'mindfulness to the fore'. The gatekeeper is now booted out of its slumber and has reported for duty. 


Step 1: Remember 'I am just sitting here'
------------------------------------------------------
In formal / seated/ supine meditation take 4 to 5 long deep abdominal breaths, settle down properly into your posture and hold the knowledge in your mind that 'I am just sitting here'. That's it, that's all you need to do in this step. You may notice body sensations, experience an ear-worm in your mind, plan an invasion, reminisce about your student days and all the girls who turned up their noses at you despite your best efforts - it doesn't matter - as long as you clearly and distinctly remember ... moment by moment ... that 'I am just sitting here'. This is the exclusive and fairly challenging training of **mindfulness**.

To hold this in smriti also means that you have now taken your adi-sthan your primordial seat. The place where you sit, part of but yet separate from the illusions that your mind weaves. A place where you sit while your mind does its job of working with sensory stimuli and creating a world around you. A place where you train the next faculty of **equanimity**. As you sit on your adi-sthan the mind will work with sensory stimuli and create your world. You experience your world without leaving your adi-sthan, without even momentarily forgetting that hey 'I am just sitting here'. Invariably a powerful itch will show up on your elbow (or better still ... your ass). It will be compelling. It will be followed by the preference to not have the itch and the desire to take action in line with your preference. Work with this in a clumsy way, experiment a bit - hate it, love it, give metta to it, grudgingly surrender to it in a passive aggressive way, but hopefully it won't go away .... and this is an opportunity!

As you try to sit on your ass on your adi-sthan creating different configurations of attitudes towards that itch you will stumble upon **equanimity**. Its an attitude of peaceful acceptance of the itch and all of its results - the preference, the call for action, the call to arms - everything! Acceptance of your own sensory experiences and reactions, while recognizing that though the trigger and the reactions are a part and parcel of your conscious experience, they are not happening to you! because hey ... 'You are just sitting here'.

Non reactivity emerges from that acceptance. Its a powerful choice of abject surrender and conquest at the same time! Remember this factor that helped you sit on your adi-sthan. Replace the itch that caused you to consider physical movement with anything equally compelling. A thought that you have forgotten to pay your credit card bill .... or your neighbor has now started to practice his bagpipes ... or anything like that which can pull you from your adi-sthan. These are opportunities to learn what equanimity is and to cultivate it, apply it on demand, or better still to keep it up, just the way you have kept up mindfulness.

The opportunity to cultivate equanimity is built in to your decision of sitting on your adi-sthan, of remembering continuously that 'I am just sitting here'. So not just do you remember that you are just sitting here, you also actually just sit here .... and work with the stuff that wants to pull you off your seat.

At which point we come to the cultivation of effort. The act of remembering something is so simple to write here ... but so difficult to actually do, with your mind continuously creating compelling worlds for you to get up from your seat and lose yourself in! You may experience that you keep forgetting ! Well then keep bringing it back. Go sit back on your adi-sthan as many times as you slip off with a firmer and firmer resolve to not slip off ... to not forget that 'I am just sitting here'. This resolve is **effort/energy/virya**.

In the application of effort, you need to deliberately balance between lollygagging and over-efforting. After working with this step for while (a couple of minutes, a couple of sits, a couple of days, a couple of weeks ...) if you aren't improving in your ability to remember ... you are lollygagging. If you find that you are holding physical tension in your body, then you are over efforting. Relax your brow every time it gets furrowed, Relax your jaw every time it gets set to kick some ass. Relax your eyes every time they get hard reflecting on how you will crush this step like a Boss. Relax your fists, relax your thighs, relax everything in your body that helps you to apply effort. Use forgetting as an indicator of under efforting. Use physical tension as an indicator of over efforting. Balance the two.

Step 2: Remember that 'I am just sitting here ... meditating'
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keep the remembrance of step 1 in mind and add to it.

You have parked yourself on your adi-sthan because ... you are supposed to be meditating! So now you begin meditating ... and you remember that you are meditating .... without forgetting that 'I am just sitting here'. Without getting up from your adi-sthan.

Begin this process by generating some curiosity about your experience. Begin by **investigation**, the next factor of awakening, of what your attention is up to. When you pay attention to sounds, know that your attention is now at the sense door of hearing. Initially you may want to use a label - 'hearing' but drop this ASAP because you aren't training your attention yet, you are training Meta-cognitive introspective awareness or MIA ... if you are familiar with TMI then you will recognize this term. MIA is supposed to do a lot of things but right now you are training it to recognize the movements of attention and the experience of attention at various sense doors. What does it feel like to be attentive to the mind, to sounds, to body, to taste, to smell ... and to sight ... if your eyes are open that is. What does it feel like when attention moves, what does it feel like when attention flickers, what does it feel like when attention gently scans the sensory environment, what does it feel like when attention rapidly moves to something with a sense of alarm accompanying it. Make attention itself your object of meditation. At no point do you control it deliberately ... not yet.

Once you feel satisfied that you understand attention and its movements experientially ... then investigate 'that' which attention moves to. Start with noticing the object generally ... after a while notice it specifically. If you were using labels ... which you should initially only if required ... then you will note sound .. smell .. body sensation ... mind object. Then you will go on to note bird song ... toast burning ... itch on the elbow ... thought about the future .... and so on. Play with this.

Side Note: By the successful conclusion of this step you would have mastered up to stage 3 of TMI

Step 3: Remember that 'I am just sitting here meditating on the breath'
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now comes the practice of directing, stabilizing and redirecting attention on the breath .... again and again until it becomes more or less stable.

While sitting on your adi-sthan, with mindfulness at the fore, with the continuous shifting and balancing of effort, with the ongoing application of equanimity, with the sense of curiosity and investigation regarding attention, its movements and the object of attention .... bring attention gently to rest on the breath.

Its absolutely OK to be distracted, just keep coming back to the breath, as long as you don't forget any of the things you are supposed to be remembering ... you are good! The continuous application of attention to the breath is assisted by the sense of investigation. Become very curious about the breath, gather data about it as long as you are on it. As you build a repository of impressions about the breath due to your sense of investigation you will start noticing some things. The in breath is cool, the out breath is warm. Some breaths are longer, some breaths are shorter, some breaths are smooth, effortless, some breaths are choppy. You don't need to do this deliberately but as attention stability increases this knowledge of how the current breath 'is' will simply emerge and be known. In order to encourage attention stability you may deliberately 'look' for this information ....but remember to balance virya/effort in the process of looking.

The subtle, more or less effortless control over attention is **concentration**. By the end of this step you should have built a great deal of it.

Step 4: Work on tranquility
------------------------------------
Keep remembering everything that you are so far supposed to be remembering.

With your attention on the breath, 'feel' your body in your awareness. Any tension, any readiness to 'do' can be detected in the body. Let go of it and relax the body. Within that relaxing the body you will discover that you are in fact relaxing the mind. The mind animates the body, keeps it ready to do stuff. You can't relax the body without relaxing the mind. As you relax the mind in terms of letting go of any intention to 'do' something you will realize that it keeps coming back. This happens because of the workings of the mind itself. It continuously builds stories, scenarios, and plays it out thus creating intentions to move and the body tenses. Get a sense of these movements of the mind and use your breath to relax the mind. On each out breath let the muscular relief associated with letting the air out, the ease you feel upon letting go of the diaphragm and the chest muscles, seep into the rest of the body and through that let go of intentions and let go of the movements of the mind. The mind becomes tranquil in response to the cue of the out breath. Intentionally replicate this effect on the in breath as well. Play with this.

With every in breath relax your body formations and your mental formations, with every out breath relax your body formations and your mental formations.

As you work on this step you may realize that you can't yet do this with awareness. No problem. Move attention away from the breath, let go of your object but keep it in the background of awareness and use your attention to seek out tension in the body and mental activity and relax ...relax. After giving a taste of this activity and what it feels like to the mind, try again to do this with attention firmly on the breath. Play with this.

This is the training of the factor of **tranquility**.

If you get to this point successfully, there is an infinite ocean of tranquility which can be cultivated. In and by itself it is a worthy goal, particularly if you are need of that tranquility to heal your mind.

...... Once you are satisfied with the degree of tranquility you gained in this step. Go back to paying attention to the breath.

Step 5: The arising of joy
-------------------------------------

While sitting on your adi-sthan, remembering that 'I am just sitting here meditating on the breath. Fix your attention on the breath at the nostrils. Doing all of the stuff that you have been doing so far, you will invariably let go of all worldly concerns and hopefully joy and rapture will arise. Smile a bit in order to encourage it. This is a game of patience. This is a game of wanting something at a meta level to happen but completely surrendering to the process without any care for outcome. This is a tricky game of balance and its successful playing leads to priti in the body with glee, pleasure and happiness in the mind. And its unmistakable. This is the arising of Joy. This may happen at any point, in any step. For me joy arises, as soon as I bring mindfulness to the fore. This is a result of regular meditation practice. In case joy does not arise for you, know that it is only a matter of time and dedication.

End Note:
------------------------------------
I have explored the depth of tranquility that can be generated. Having established all other mental factors firmly, tranquility can be boosted as if on steroids. Using the steroid enhanced :) tranquility as a base, any further investigation of conscious experience or deepening of concentration to reach the nimmita and access the jhanas at greater depth becomes ridiculously easy to do. To very systematically go through the motions I have described in my post is time consuming. In case you wish to try this, I recommend that you do it lying down supine. Seated is also OK I guess. If you create the setup of all other mental factors correctly, particularly mindfulness and investigation, then the mind learns how to do this without the dry algorithmic steps. Tranquility can simply be 'called up' in the middle of any kind of meditation. It can even be called up off the cushion provided that the mind feels safe.
