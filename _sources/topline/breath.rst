The Breath Nimitta - Protocol and explanation on aud
=====================================================
Introduction
---------------
This is a protocol that an advanced meditator can follow to reach the breath nimitta in one go.The initial steps of the protocol can also form the basis for a daily practice for someone wishing to progress. Simply begin with the first few steps that take you to the breath and stay there, adding further steps every week. Week on week building a firm concentration practice. The protocol does not address hindrances and other problems that come about. But if you keep a log of how each sit goes and review it every couple of weeks, that forms the basis for protocol tweaks and additional exercises.

The protocol though, the way it is written, assumes a lot of proficiency with directing attention at choice and with a skill called softening into which you can read about :ref:`here <Softening>`.

`Here <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rtLrOyfiHzq_Ed0Go2B_zqxExa-Q49IJ>`_ is a link to a two part series of talks that cover the prerequisites required to get to the jhana. Part 2 of the talk focuses specifically on access concentration and how it is a spectrum and how at the deeper end of access concentration comes up a breath nimitta - giving a sense of how concentration practice develops, what to watch out for.

19. Soften into the need to pay attention to sounds and body sensations
20. Remember the breath and let attention flit to mental mental objects
21. 21.Slowly narrow the focus of attention to the nostrils and let attention flit to mental objects

23. Keep doing this until attention engages only with the tactile sensations at the nostrils
24. Deliberately pay attention to a couple of thoughts - bring attention back to nostrils
25. Deliberately pay attention to a couple of emotions - bring attention back to the nostrils
26. Deliberately pay attention to aggregate mental states changing - bring attention back to nostrils
27. Do this till introspective awareness is powerful
28. Now engage - in sequence with the elements at the nostrils - earth, water, wind, fire, void
29. While doing this generate a curiosity regarding what's happening in the mind
30. ----Are you thinking - Auditory, visual, meaning based? Past, present, future fantasy? Self, other, world, fantasy?
31. ---- Mental state - relaxed, agitated, neutral?
32. Once MIA is developed, simply allow the breath at the nostrils to congeal into one conceptual object - here is the breath â€¦. And stay like that - you will get the breath nimitta
