Mindfulness meditation on thoughts and the thinking process
==============================================================================

**Introduction (with some relevant personal background):**

In my meditation journey one of the most striking benefits I have ever received is by having developed a sensitivity, familiarity and intuitive understanding of the thinking process.

Before I ever meditated, I struggled for a long period of time with depression and anxiety and decided to address this problem using mindfulness meditation as well as a therapy modality called REBT. REBT requires one to identify harsh, all or nothing kinds of views and attitudes within oneself and challenge them intellectually. The hypothesis is that if you can soften the harshness of these attitudes and views, you can reduce or even overcome the mood disorder. My main problem of working with this mode of therapy was an inability to accept that 'I' could change that which 'I' considered an integral part of 'myself'. How can a knife cut out a part of itself.

Once very early on in my journey, in a session where I was working with the breath, I was really nicely settled on the breath. Attention and interest fully engaged. A neighbor's dog started barking. This triggered irritation. I thought, *here I was trying to meditate and here was that dog trying to mess things up for me. Fuck that dog! I hate that dog! I fucking hate all dogs, everywhere in every corner of the world!* While all of this was happening, 'I' was completely settled in and enjoying the meditation on the breath!

This was absolutely eye opening! 'I' didn't do the thinking, 'I' didn't do the creation of a harsh attitude - then why in heaven's name should I take ownership and grasp closely to myself **any** form of thinking, any attitude any harsh self-view or any world-view. From that point onward I turned a sharp corner in my therapy leading to a rapid decline in my symptoms. I believe this was made possible by having intentionally worked quite a bit in meditation with thoughts.

The following exercises are what I worked with and will attempt to explain in my post. These are exercises created by established experienced teachers. I haven't invented anything, though I often tweak and re-purpose tools and techniques all the time.

Notes:

    1. If you suffer from any clinically diagnosed mental health problem or any severe strain in your life like a divorce or unemployment or bereavement - these practices may not be right for you right now. You can always check it out a week, a month or an year later. I am not an expert or a teacher, my journey is unique to me, you must be cautious.
    2. Before doing any of these exercises it make a lot of sense to work with that which you are familiar (the breath or body scan for example) for a short period of time and get some momentum of mindfulness, concentration and tranquility going. Consider this as preparation for the exercises to be done within the same session.
    3. Whenever mindfulness collapses or any kind of anguish or discomfort is felt, let go of the exercise and come back to your preparatory exercise. Then begin again if and when you feel you are ready. There is no rush!

**Exercise 1: Developing familiarity with thinking - visual and auditory**

Source: Guided meditation created by Marcelo Spinella - with some variations

    1. Deliberately bring to mind a very simple image. A blue circle on a white background for eg. Hold it in your attention for a brief period of time. The clarity of the image is not important! You can 'see' this image, develop a familiarity and a sense of this way of seeing. The way in which you can see this image is more important than the image itself. Now drop the image. Just drop it! Don't intentionally bring any image to mind but continue the way of 'seeing' with a very relaxed and curious attitude. Mental imagery will come up. Sometimes isolated sometimes in the form of a chain of connected images. Keep observing in a relaxed, non involved attitude. If you get caught up in the 'story' and mindfulness collapses then go back to the preparatory practice that you were doing and after a while begin again.
    2. Deliberately bring to mind a simple set of imagined sounds - recite the alphabet slowly and deliberately - A ... B ... C .... and so on. You can 'hear' this imagined sound. Stay with it till you get a good sense of the way in which you can hear this sound. Then drop it, don't intentionally do anything but continue listening with a relaxed and curious attitude. Thinking that presents itself in the form of imagined sounds will come up. Sometimes in nonsensical meaningless snippets, sometimes in coherent meaningful sentences. Keep listening as long as you can be mindful. Engage with the 'form' and not the meaning of what you hear. If mindfulness collapses, like before, go back to your familiar preparatory practice and then being again
    3. Deliberately imagine a simple story with a visual and a sound. I imagine Donald Duck waddling around ... quacking. Now you can 'see' and 'hear' at the same time. How are you doing this? get a sense of this doing and then peacefully let Donald Duck go .... you know what to do next. :)

**Exercise 2: Developing familiarity with thinking - pure meaning**

Source: guided meditation by Culadasa (created for a completely different objective) - with some variations and completely repurposed

(This exercise requires that you have some familiarity with the previous exercise)

Once you are comfortable establishing mindfulness with mental objects particularly thinking. Do some preparatory practice. Spend some time watching and listening to your thoughts.

Then deliberately bring to mind a few words and a few phrases which carry a lot of meaning. Give your mind a taste of these words and then let them go! And observe your mind. You will know you are thinking triggered by that phrase, but chances are you may not be doing all of your thinking with images or sounds. Some of your thinking triggered by the meaning and the emotional charge of your chosen phrase will be meaning based itself. You 'know' you are thinking, but you cant pin it down to imagery or vocalization.

If this doesn't happen naturally then hold the phrase for longer, deliberately investigate what that phrase means to you - how does it makes you feel, where does the feeling naturally go ... and so on. Engage deeply with the meaning of the phrase, then let it go and then observe.

Deliberately choose words or phrases that have a **positive** emotional charge - **do not be adventurous here**. I use the following (as examples):

Peace

Happiness

Family

Friendship

Love

Health

**Exercise 3: Developing familiarity and sensitivity to the process of thinking itself**

Source - Guided meditation by Stephen Procter (MIDL) - with significant variations

(This exercise can be done on a standalone basis, it does not require the previous exercises)

First get started with your preparatory exercise. Get some momentum going with mindfulness, concentration, tranquility. Then move your attention to include your entire body. Put one hand in the other. Slowly restrict attention from a larger scope to a narrower scope and bring it to the touch of your hands, then do the following steps sequentially. Every time you investigate thinking in any one of these steps - remember to stop after a short while and keep coming back to the touch of your hands. Establish the momentum and stability of mindfulness, concentration, tranquility again and to begin investigating again.

    1. Reduce the grip of attention on the touch of your hands. Intend to be open to the idea of it going to your mind. Don't force the process. Just wait! Patiently! Attention will move to breath, body, sounds etc. Don't worry about that, let that go and come back to your hands. Attention will be pulled by thoughts. When this happens, notice the moment this happens, notice that thoughts have a 'pull' on attention. Just notice that you are thinking. Notice what it feels like to have attention move or jump or shift to thinking. Do this for a short period of time.
    2. Stay with your hands for a while then reduce the grip of attention. Every time attention goes to a thought notice the kind of thought that it is. You may now be familiar with visualization, vocalization, meaning based thoughts, try and see if you can catch tactile and olfactory thoughts. In your thoughts you may find yourself drinking a hot cup of bitter sweet coffee on a cold winter morning. The mind and the thinking process mimics each and every one of the five senses when it creates thoughts. Develop an appreciation for this
    3. Begin with your hands again. Let attention go to thoughts - look for the kind of thought it is and its associated emotional charge - are you thinking about the past, the future or the present. Are you planning, fantasizing, regretting, reminiscing, etc. Is the thought driven by curiosity, anger, revulsion, love, fascination, concern - can you discern what drives the thought. Note this or use a short label if you must each time you do this step.
    4. Begin with your hands again. Let attention go to thoughts. Hold the following questions in mind - one by one - don't look for an analytical answer but an experiential answer to these questions. How do you know that you are thinking? How does the mind know that this is a thought and not an actual image or sound. What is the experiential felt sense of a thought as opposed to the prick of a pin, the bark of a dog, the smell of a rose - whats the difference? Where is the thought taking place. If there is a sound and a thought, or if there are two thoughts - is one behind the other or to its left or to its right or are they overlapped - does the mind have a space with Cartesian coordinates?

If you are new to meditation, such exercises may not be easy for you. Whether you receive success with any one of these exercises depends on your natural knack for this kind of meditation as well as the skills that you have gained through practice. For me I worked with these exercises very early on in my practice. But I struggled a lot in order to gain some skill with this kind of work. You may find that you are currently unable to do this. Don't worry about it you can always come back to it later. Or you can try persisting with this in your broader practice and see something clicks.

In case you find this useful and try this out for yourself do write back about how it worked for you.
