Alternative approach to TMI - still point and witness practice
==============================================================================

**Introduction:**

I don't think I have created a top line post here before. I am a diligent, committed practitioner. I do multiple different practices but currently TMI is the mainstay of my practice. I am practicing at stage 8. I am fairly dexterous with the 8 jhanas as taught in Leigh Brasington's book. My foundation skills come from a system called MIDL.

Through using the instruction set of 'experiencing stillness' from a different system (MIDL) with some minor additions, I have worked out a way of finding the still point and realizing the witness which is different from the TMI instruction set. I haven't invented anything, I have used one methodology to arrive at the outcome of a different practice methodology. The practice technique is different enough to warrant a post. I am sure that this is a clone of something that already exists, I just haven't come across it anywhere yet.

My objective is to describe this alternative approach for folks who may not have found success with the TMI instruction set for the still point and witness practice. You can and should check this out. I learnt the basics of this technique outlined in MIDL at the very beginning of my practice and not towards the later stages as TMI recommends, thus suggesting to me that this approach may succeed in case the TMI recommended approach isn't working well.

**Preparation:**

Get started. Do metta, anapanasati, body scan, whatever works best for you. The mental factors of awakening that you need to concern yourself, and get some momentum going, with are Mindfulness, Concentration and Investigation. You need to be strongly mindful. You need to have moderate concentration and investigation. Permit me to define how I am using these words in order to have a common shared understanding for the rest of this post. I am doing this not because I am assuming ignorance on the part of the reader but because I myself am relatively weaker with theory and sometimes use the wrong words for the right thing!

Mindfulness: The exercise of short term working memory where you are holding the fact moment by moment that 'here you are and this is what you are doing'. The 'here' and 'this' changes as you follow the instructions.

Concentration: Dexterity and control over powerful attention. Holding it steady and making it go where you want it to go.

Investigation: The spirit or intention of curiosity and wanting to know more about whatever is going on right here right now.

For this practice you don't need to encourage Joy or equanimity. Tranquility is an outcome of the practice and energy in excess is actually a problem. Just let them be.

**Use your body to teach your mind how to relax:**

Start paying attention to smaller parts of your body starting from top to bottom, or the other way around. Select body parts in line with musculature. Jaw, neck, biceps, triceps and so on. Stay on a single body part for at least 4 to 5 breaths or more. On the out breath deliberately try to relax the body part. While you are doing this be observant, curious, investigative of what is happening in the mind.

**Experience the mental mechanism of 'letting go':**

I am never physically fully relaxed because I am carrying readiness in my mind. Readiness to listen, to speak, to do, to judge, to think etc. In the act of relaxation of the body lies a 'letting go' of readiness in the mind. The mind 'lets go' of readiness in order to relax the body. As you proceed with relaxation on the out breath of body parts for a short period of time you will get a very good sense of what 'letting go' is. And this is crucial for the rest of the instructions.

**Let go of ..... everything:**

At some point once you have gotten a good solid sense of what letting go is, just stop the body relaxation thingy and stay in a state of open awareness letting attention move wherever it wants to move. Remember to be very very mindful. While attention is doing whatever it wants to do, moment by moment you should know exactly where attention is and what its is engaging with. In this state of choice less movements of attention deliberately start to let go of interest, enchantment with the object that attention is engaged with. You can do this either on the out breath or free form. So one by one as objects arise in attention you are letting go of the object thus attention just doesn't engage with objects anymore.

For example you let go of one sound, then the next, then the next and at some point let of of the entire hearing process. In parallel interspersed with the above, you let go of one thought, then the next, then the next and then let go of the entire thinking process ... and so on ..... with every object and every sense door.

**The still point and the witness:**

Instead of directing attention to the still point what happens is that you just aren't letting it engage with anything. And rather than a robust affirmative manipulation, this is a gentle peaceful negation. This is a practice of 'Not doing'. After a while attention just settles down (at the still point) by itself. At this point there is one final letting go to be done. Let go of the intention to let go. There is a lot of potential for misunderstanding in this statement perhaps. Prima facie it sounds like a nonsensically endlessly recursive thing. But don't worry about that. Let go of the desire to let go. Upon doing this successfully here's what I experience.

    1. Attention seems to fold back on itself ! This is a unique thing for me. It never happens unless I am doing it in this way. And I realize the witness.
    2. At this point I experience unbelievable levels of relaxation, tranquility, stillness whatever term is appropriate - maybe this is like 'the relaxation response' on steroids!

**What next? :**

In line with the premise of alternatives to TMI instruction set:

    1. In case you suffer from insomnia, disturbed and unsatisfying sleep, tossing and turning the whole night making yourself much more miserable - like me. Enter the still point and witness state, drop any and every interest in deliberately investigating anything whatsoever. If investigation happens - well and good, don't intend it. Just nicely and richly marinate yourself in the experience of tranquility / stillness on steroids. I do this often, helps me live with insomnia. See if this works for you. In this sleep substitute state, unification / ekagrata keeps increasing. So there is some contribution to the awakening project as well.
    2. Reduce the power of consciousness within attention and divert it towards awareness. Turn attention into a mere sliver, steady but weak. And turn awareness into a diffuse but increasingly powerful thing and investigate phenomena operating in parallel within awareness. This is an insight practice, I find it difficult to describe how it works but a couple of times I have popped a fruition doing this. So I guess something's working here though I don't have the ability to put it into words.

**Note:**

To keep the post short and readable I have not elaborated on some things. I know I am talking to fellow practitioners who are very advanced but still! Here are the gaps:

    1. What is meant by, and how do you go about dialing up or dialing down the mental factors of awakening like energy, investigation etc. on the fly
    2. What is meant by and how do you do reducing the power of attention and increasing the power of awareness on the fly

If you try this then please write back and let me know how it worked for you. I would be absolutely delighted.

Cheers
