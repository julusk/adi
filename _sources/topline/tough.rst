When practice becomes tough
==============================
We usually live in a world of abstractions - jobs, family, friends, a conception of who we are and how well (or badly) adjusted we are in our environment. Our perception, cognition, and affect functions are all attuned to the world of abstractions. We have learnt strategies of how to make sense of and deal with jobs, colleagues, family, bullies, friends, lovers, our identities, our goals, our ambitions etc. In the world of abstractions these strategies work to keep us mostly functional. The operating term is 'mostly functional'. There is always a niggle, a feeling of something not quite right, and sometimes that feeling intensifies. It is the intensity of that feeling which brings us to awakening practices. It is very unlikely that anyone in their right minds, being perfectly well adjusted in the world, would sit on their ass for hours each day and pay attention to the breath at the nostrils or sounds, or thoughts. It is always the niggle - with varying degrees of intensity that brings us to this very strange very counterintuitive practice.

This practice then takes us out of the world of abstraction into a world of sensations, phenomena, how they are sensed, and how they are related to. It takes us into the domain of subjective conscious experience. In this domain we develop observational skills and discover some 'laws' that govern this domain. The way the domain of the physical world is governed by laws like the law of gravity, or the law of conservation of angular momentum, similarly the world of subjective personal direct conscious experience also has its own laws.

We discover and gain knowledge about those laws. But what we are also supposed to do in parallel is to gain wisdom regarding how to manage the mind given that these laws exist. And to gain dispassion towards the mechanisms that move the mind in opposition to these laws.

If practice becomes tough, and it becomes tough for everyone for at least some time, its because we have the skills of observation, but we haven't cultivated the skills that the mind needs in order for wisdom and dispassion to arise.

**Skill of observation** - Mindfulness, concentration, investigation, energy

**Skill of acceptance / wisdom** - Relaxation, Joy, equanimity

**Skill of dispassion** - softening into experience, changing the way the mind relates to experience, withdrawal of participation in the habitual tendencies of the mind so that they are deprived of fuel and they wither and die.

We believe, and we aren't necessarily wrong, that wisdom and dispassion will naturally emerge from knowledge. We will naturally become wise in terms of how we manage the mind, naturally become dispassionate towards the mechanisms that move the mind going contrary to the laws (dhammas) that govern conscious experience . And yes it happens. The learning happens on its own. But that kind of learning is very very harsh. We have to help it along by cultivating - Relaxation, Joy, equanimity, skills of dispassion.

A well balanced practice plan will incorporate within it the cultivation of these skills.

It is natural to be inclined towards our strengths. Our strengths may lie in mindfulness, concentration and investigation - and by utilizing these we may feel we are gaining more and more knowledge. But knowledge without wisdom isn't sustainable. Wisdom without dispassion towards the unwholesome is an incomplete project

The hard charging aggressive go-getter-ish style of practice isn't sustainable. It just leads to freaking out and then we freak out about the freaking out.

The terms dukkha nana is very interesting. When there is dukkha there is always a little bit of nana. We train ourselves to be observant and then the nana increases. Finally there is enough knowledge to carry us into equanimity and at the other end of equanimity to a marga phal moment. But if the nana/knowledge doesn't become the wisdom of managing the mind, the wisdom doesn't become dispassion towards the unwholesome then we enter a phase of practice characterized by seemingly infinite cycles where each pass through the dukkha nana leaves us disappointed with, dejected because of and sick to our guts of this practice.

Practice changes
--------------------
If we find ourselves in such a situation we have to take a feedback from what is happening to us and we have to realize that we need course correction. We have to direct practice to include skills that we may have neglected. The following skills are what I would recommend be incorporated in a practice plan:

**1. Dialing up or down each factor of awakening**

Use an anchor to rest attention on and fully experience each factor of awakening as it gets established, play with each factor, tweak it

**2. The deliberate cultivation of tranquillity**

Use an anchor to rest attention on, establish mindfulness, increase energy/sensitivty to a certain degree in order to not fall asleep, and learn how to relax, build tranquility - and take it as far as it can possibly go

**3. Generating dispassion - softening into**

Learn the mechanics of softening into from MIDL - understand that it needs to become your own native skill set rather than some term from some system of practice. Apply softening into to all sense doors. Choose a particular sense door and let objects self select, don't control attention - just simply soften into the object which is currently in the foreground. Do this at a micro level - like softening into the elemental quality of fire in body sensations. Do this at a macro level - like softening into the entire sense door of the mind. From the micro to the macro - as experience arises - learn to change the way the mind relates to experience. Move away from passion to dispassion, from greed, hatred and confusion to dispassion and then equanimity

Brahmaviharas
---------------
When nicely and properly frazzled by insight practice, to the extent that one has begun to feel physically or mentally sick - it is necessary to halt insight in its tracks. To keep gaining knowledge with absolutely no idea of how to gain wisdom and dispassion is a disaster!!!! Stop the unfolding of insight in its tracks by cultivating the brahmaviharas - particularly metta in case it is the most accessible to you.

The Brahmiviharas are like a constructed platform of relating to ... stuff. From sensations, to compound objects to an obnoxious colleague at work. The Brahmaviharas teach us how not to relate to stuff from a platform of competition and adversarial-ness. This is a very important skill for life on this shore as well as the other shore. For this reason alone the Brahmaviharas are a wonderful practice. But right now apart from this they will put a full stop to the constant rapid cycling. They will permit the mind and the body to heal from the trauma that comes with knowledge without wisdom and dispassion.
