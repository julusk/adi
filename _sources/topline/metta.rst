The strategic use of metta meditation
========================================
**Metta and positive mental states**

Baked into our mental make up are what are called the sanyojanas / 10 fetters that drives one down the chain of Dependent Origination to take birth against a contact. The birth we take determines the kind of mental states that accompany that particular birth. If we use metta mediation it will create the causes and conditions necessary for us to take birth in worlds with a lot of positive mental states. It can also by regular use train our minds to keep creating worlds of bliss and happiness and positivity. It can also by regular use improve our relationships in this relative world of people, jobs, social contracts, thus laying the ground for further positive mental states. Metta certainly creates positive mental states.

**But! But! But! But!**

Kwashiorkor happens because of a deficiency of protein. Scurvy happens because of a deficiency of Vitamin C. Very dissimilarly, Dukkha does not happen because of a deficiency of Metta. Suffering happens because of the tendency to take birth. Whether we experience positive mental states or negative ones, if we take birth within them - they will disappoint us - positive mental states will pass away leaving us experiencing the dread of loss, negative mental states will come making us feel horrible misery. Sooner ... or later! We may do some more and more and more and more metta of course ... but then the entire cycle just keeps repeating. In order to address suffering we have to figure out a way of ending the tendency to take birth, for which we have to eliminate the 10 fetters, for which we have to study and understand the chains of Dependent Origination.

Imagine that the 10 fetters are like corpses that have been buried somewhere in your back garden. The stink of those corpses which sometimes is absent, sometimes is weak and sometimes is strong, is Dukkha. The only way to be free of that stink once and for all is to exhume that corpse and BURN IT ! Burn it under the heat of awareness and wisdom. The only way to locate that corpse is to follow the trail of the stink. Metta meditation is like a perfume or a room freshener that we keep spraying in our back garden. The more we spray the more the stink is masked and the more difficult it is to find that corpse. The job at hand is hindered by metta meditation. But .. what about Uncle Sid? Did he not praise Metta meditation? I wasn't there when Uncle was prescribing Metta, I don't know what was on his mind. But I can recommend a few strategies to use Metta meditation wisely.

**Strategy 1 - Muscle relaxant for a lower back spasm**

When you get a lower back spasm, you can't move, you can't do anything! The pain may be unbearable. The only cure for a lower back spasm is either to rest and pray that it gets resolved (it rarely does on its own) or it is to slowly and gradually do lumbar back exercises that strengthen the very muscles that are hurt. The only way to get yourself out of bed and onto the yoga mat is to take muscle relaxants. A fixed planned dose for a defined duration - not more than that - its addictive!

Similarly do Metta Bhavana so that you do Shamatha Bhavana so that you can do Vipashyana Bhavana and then locate the stink and follow it to its source, exhume the dead body and burn it. Too much Metta Bhavana - you get addicted - you do disservice to the Awakening Project. Too little Metta Bhavana - you remain bed ridden and the yoga mat gathers dust!

**Strategy 2 - Towards or at the end of the Awakening Project**

Metta can be seen as three separate practices:

    1. Cultivate and focus on the feeling of metta - This then becomes a concentration practice

    2. Creating a platform to relate to the rest of the world as opposed to a platform of competition and a zero-sum game - This then becomes a Brahma-vihara lite practice

    3. Coloring awareness with the color of metta. When awareness engages with any object, then it is now structured in a way that metta (or/and karuna, mudita and upekkha) are coloring awareness itself almost constantly - this then becomes a Brahma-vihara heavy duty industrial grade practice

When you do #3 **and** then train awareness to engage with sense contact and cut the chain of DO at contact itself - which means nothing carries vedana anymore. But the structuring / coloring of awareness itself provides positive vedana - thus the very act of being aware feels 'sweet' This is the sweet essence, the drop of nectar (present against all sense contacts). Irrespective of what is happening to you. This flies in the face of the common position that DO can only be cut at vedana. This takes you into the territory of The Madhu-pindika sutra and The culavedalla sutra. Fairly high yogic achievement. In the common ordinary world such a position will severely handicap house-holdership. But luckily it is a choice, it can be turned on and off.

**Lots of Metta but no strategy**

You may do Shamatha Bhavana using metta itself, you may do Vipashyana Bhavana - but the bodies remain buried ... because the stink is now masked! The Awakening Project feels complete ... but its not!

Oh and you may also end up with a special 'Loving Kindness Voice' - you know what I am talking about right? I think you do! :) Check `This <https://twitter.com/TylerAlterman/status/1335863902274457600>`_ out. :)
Personally when I hear the 'Loving Kindness Voice' I do a quick inventory check of my wallet, my cards, my phone, my car keys.

Thank you for reading. Please only write back from direct experience or the aspiration for direct experience. This subreddit has no place for textual knowledge unless it is backed by direct experience or the aspiration for direct experience which needs to be loud and clear in topline posts as well as comments on topline posts. The objective is to completely discourage low effort noise as well as textual scholarship which sometimes masks as execution of The Awakening Project. At some point as soon as I can figure out how to operate the moderator functions I will create weekly threads where you can show off your textbook championship if you still want to despite heavy discouragement. Until then ... please excuse.
