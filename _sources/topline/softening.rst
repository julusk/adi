.. _Softening:

Softening into - what I gained and learnt from it
===================================================
This post is about how the practice of softening into worked for me.

First of all I think its a brilliant practice with applicability across all other practice types - be it the development of samadhi or the practice of deliberate intentional investigation or of stillness (or nirvikalpa samadhi). I am really writing from memory of my own practice and thus might be imprecise in terms of time-line and sequence of development as the skill developed.

Began with MIDL, knew almost nothing about mindfulness meditation or satipatthana practice beyond the very basics of theory I had picked up here and there. No direct experience. At that time the MIDL curriculum had a certain flow - a few flexible attention practices designed to ground awareness in the body came before softening into was introduced as a specific set of techniques and I had decided to simply follow the sequence. Slow deep diaphragmatic breaths taught me that some degree of ease and comfort can be brought into aggregate experience irrespective of what may be currently happening. In meditation as well as off the cushion the slow deep diaphragmatic breathing practice (along with other softening skills) simply started showing up initially by intentionally remembering to do this and eventually by its own accord. As part of the curriculum, I moved on to other exercises related to softening into as a skill and very very patiently worked upon it, fully trusting the process.

**Notes on lessons learnt:**

    1. The first lesson learnt was that 'experience' should not be pushed away. To form an attitude of hitting upon or trying to grab on to experience simply leads to anxiety and a better strategy was to relax and practice softening into breaths as the experience happened

    2. The curiosity required to learn from experience is interrupted by anxiety. By just softening into the aggregate experience of what is happening now it is possible to be investigative about the aggregate experience or its components as well as the reactions in the citta (heart-mind) and manas (the intellect)

    3. I discovered that in the face of an object in experience when I do softening into the experience there are multiple things happening. It is a very complex thing, what started as a simple exercise of following MIDL instructions itself became a revelation regarding how the mind and body are deeply connected

    4. Initially I thought that the relaxation of the body leads to the relaxation of the mind. Then I learnt that the cause and effect relationship is actually not as simple as I thought. The body was a lump of clay, it was the mind that animated the body and produced the markers of stress and that softening into was working on the mind and therefore the body.

    5. Within the mind I understood that the affective response was causing stress in the body but in turn affect is deeply linked with cognition. The way in which an object of experience is processed. I discovered that the basic preverbal mental models that come into play and act on any trigger leads to an affective response which in turn leads to a physical response

    6. Further experience with softening into taught me that its not cognition really, its how awareness or the knowing function of the mind 'meets' the object in awareness. Many things that we believe are cognitive like holding expectations from ongoing experience, demanding that it be a certain way, rejecting it, maintaining separation and distance from it. these things aren't an aspect of the intellect that is 'stored' the way a computer would store and act on an algorithm. These aren't conceptual constructs, these are like stances of awareness ... 'postures' ... baked into the very shape that awareness takes when it meets its objects.

    7. Awareness meets objects with a 'stance', this has cognitive, conceptual equivalents, this has affective, emotional equivalents, this has bodily results in terms of the stress and strain that we feel due to anxiety.

    8. So today if I practice softening into, I am actually softening into the stance that awareness takes. And it has three standard stances with multiple flavors - greed, hatred, delusion

    9. So practice evolved into following vipassana techniques but on an ongoing basis, as part of the daily humdrum of vipassana practice ... simply softening into and releasing the mind from these stances. Again ... and again ... and again ... and again.

**The contribution of 'softening into' towards other practice styles:**

    1. In stable attention practice - samadhi/shamatha/jhana - instead of using will power, intentionality and repetition therefore habituation, to stabilize attention on one object, it makes sense to first begin to recognize that there are six sense doors and multiple objects that make up our conscious experience. Our chosen object is one of them. Holding in memory our chosen object, we can simply start softening into other objects, as awareness flits around from object to object. We soften into objects, we soften into sense doors, we soften into the compulsion that drives attention, we soften into the need to scan our environment, we soften into greed for positive vedana that might be available somewhere out there, we soften into the aversion to this silly object (maybe the breath, maybe the body). Basically I learnt how to soften into experience and thereby reaching stable attention/jhana :)

    2. In insight practice - vipashyana/vipassana, we get pushed and pulled by various hindrances. Here I am doing these strange exercises, will I get something? how long is it going to take, when will 'realization' happen? what in heavens name is 'realization'? why the F*** am I doing this? .... we soften into this ... and we continue practicing. I just can't sit here anymore, I have to get up, I have to do something ... anything! ... we soften into this. I am a educated urban professional, my problems come from my life ... why don't I use this time to think about and try and solve those problems rather than this silly exercise .... we soften into this. Here I am listening to sounds, sounds change, every time sounds change ... I feel a tiny amount of anxiety, or sometimes it makes me feel miserable ... gosh I can't do this anymore ... we soften into this. We soften into objects, we soften into their characteristics, we soften into our resistance to continue observing objects and their characteristics, we soften into the affective responses emerging from that observation, we keep doing vipashyana and we keep softening into any resistance we have to continue doing vipashyana. This is what I learnt.

I would love to hear from you. Are you currently practicing softening into? Have you practiced it in the past? How is it working for you? How has it worked for you in the past? What did you gain? What did you learn?
