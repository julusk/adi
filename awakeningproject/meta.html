<section id="about-the-awakening-project">
<h2>About the Awakening Project<a class="headerlink" href="#about-the-awakening-project" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The Awakening Project is deeply informed by my practice which in turn is deeply informed by the work of Stephen Procter (midlmeditation.com), Siddharth Gautam, and their guidance and direction on achieving freedom from suffering. It is also deeply informed by a brilliant teacher of Asanga’s Elephant Path - one who cannot, should not, must not be named, lest ignominy falls upon The Awakening Project! No ..No ..No … we cannot have that happening! Absolutely not … how can we? even though the man is dead and gone!</p>
<p>Unlike any religion, tradition, sect that has emerged from Siddharth Gautam’s teachings, The Awakening Project stays true and consistent with <strong>experientially</strong> understanding what suffering is, understanding where it comes from and completely taking it apart, demolishing it, vanquishing it, becoming free of it. All strange socio cultural fluff like mala beads, golden statues, incense sticks, pali pushing, sutta peddling is dropped completely in The Awakening Project. The author - me - is a middle aged Indian dude and has absolutely no hostility towards incense sticks or to prostrations, in fact the author is known to light a couple of incense sticks now and then and walk around saying namaste to people at social occasions. <strong>But</strong> such things are recognized as completely incidental to the project. A complete waste of time and mental bandwidth as far as the objective of awakening is concerned. The author uses Sanskrit, Magadhi Prakrit (mistakenly called Pali) freely as languages just like C, C#, Pascal, Fortran. Language is needed to communicate. The message is important, the language is a medium.</p>
<p>Many people on encountering suffering go looking for one more idol, one more ideal, one more in-group, one more identity, one more self soothing story, one more highly conceptual superstition based religion, one more way of worshipping, one more cultural artefact that they can bow or prostrate or genuflect in front of, one more set of concepts that they can gain academic scholarship on …… The Awakening Project does not concern itself with any of that!</p>
<p>The fundamental principle of The Awakening Project can be encapsulated perfectly in the following way:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Gain calmness, collectedness, observational skills through cultivating them in meditation</p></li>
<li><p>Guard those skills by watching your attitudes, thoughts, speech and behavior in daily life thereby understanding your mind as it interacts with the world</p></li>
<li><p>Use the skills thus cultivated and guarded in order to investigate the mind using well crafted time tested rubrics that act as a vector for investigation, designed to uncover the mechanisms that cause suffering</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The natural progression of awakening goes through certain stages that are in synch with the order of the ten fetters from the previous chapter. On overcoming the first three fetters one achieves the stage of Awakening called Shrotapanna, on overcoming the 4th and 5th fetter one achieves a stage of Awakening called Anagami. On the way to Anagami, these fetters and the way they manifest are understood thus through intentionality and self observation their expression can be consistently interrupted. Thus these fetters are significantly weaker. This stage prior to Anagami is called Sakrdagami. On overcoming the last 5 fetters one reaches a stage called Arhat. At this stage all latent tendencies that color the working of the mind and cause cognitive friction or dukkha are completely eliminated. For ever!</p>
<p>This skill development, this application of those skills, these results are perfectly do-able. This requires a certain level of interest, some degree of willingness to accept the concept of freedom from suffering and applying one’s self consistently, diligently, energetically, in a very very structured and street smart way. Some degree of co-operation from life and circumstances like physical and mental health are required. How much time, how much energy, how much consistence, how much diligence will be required for any individual is not known. It is variable. But one would never know it unless one applies themselves. The broad timeline ranges from 7 days to 7 lifetimes. This is a very large variance. Thus there is an element of raw talent which is undeniable but we don’t get to choose how much talent we have. Try as I might I cannot run the 4 minute mile, but that doesn’t stop me from getting off my couch and walking for half an hour around the block.</p>
<p><strong>The structure of The Awakening Project</strong></p>
<p>The Awakening Project is loosely structured like the Smriti Upasthana Sutra (Satipatthana Sutta in Magadhi Prakrit). To develop the skills needed to establish mindfulness and then apply it towards the 4 foundations or domains of experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Body (5 senses)</p></li>
<li><p>Mind (the 6th sense)</p></li>
<li><p>Vedana (emotional valence associated with the 2 prior foundations)</p></li>
<li><p>Operating Principles that describe behavior between the 3 foundations</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In order to actualize this we use a few well crafted rubrics and exercises designed around those rubrics</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Cultivation of mental faculties listed in the 7 factors of awakening, plus some other crucial skills. Collectively - for the sake of convenience I will call this shamatha bhavana. These factors and associated skills have to be kept going through out the entirety of the project. These skills aren’t permanent and deteriorate with disuse and are also affected by accruing insights which can be unsettling. Thus this is a set of exercises that continue in parallel to investigation through out the duration of the project</p></li>
<li><p>The rubric of the six sense doors to attain Shrotapanna</p></li>
<li><p>The rubric of Pratitya Samutpad or dependent origination to attain Anagami (and Sakrdagami on the way)</p></li>
<li><p>The rubric of the Pancha Skandha or 5 aggregates to attain Arhat.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>From #s 2,3,4 the exercises collectively will be called vipashyana bhavana in this book</p>
<p><strong>Structuring a daily meditation practice</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning simply pick up shamatha bhavana as your daily practice and start practicing. Use the exercises in that section to start developing observational skills and start structuring your day, week, month in such a way as to support a consistent daily meditation practice. Begin modestly with 20 minutes per day. Increase this over a period of a couple of weeks to 20 minutes two times a day. Both sessions at different times or with a single small break in between, doesn’t matter. Eventually move on to developing a rhythm of practice that contains at least one session of a minimum of 45 minutes or more if you can manage it. Do multiple sessions if you can manage it. Once you have established a consistent daily practice, one weekend every month, manage your life so that you have two days - Saturday and Sunday for eg - completely free and meditate for 6 to 8 hours each day</p>
<p>In parallel to formal practice - use some well crafted instructions to carry those skills into daily life. Initially this transition will be difficult to achieve but persistent application of the techniques will make them easier to do and then daily life becomes a part and parcel of formal practice</p>
<p>Within the first few weeks when a basic daily consistency is developed start to alternate 4 shamatha bhavana sessions with one vipashyana bhavana session. It is advisable to begin with the six sense doors and to stick to that rubric until the attainment of Shrotapanna. So you are consistently alternating between a shamatha practice and a vipashyana practice in a 80% - 20% mix.</p>
<p>Along the way if life cooperates and you are able to reach a daily consistent practice of 2 hours, at that point shift the mix of shamatha - vipashyana to 50% - 50%. Soon you will realize that the distinction drawn between shamatha bhavana and vipashyana bhavana is actually contrived and a mere convenience to direct intentionality in practice and the two practices will merge.</p>

<section id="what-is-awakening">
<h2>What is awakening<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-awakening" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>For the purpose of this book, this term has only one meaning. To understand what Dukkha is, to understand how the mind constructs Dukkha and to teach it to stop doing it. The definition of Dukkha and the ten fetter model in the previous chapter is the basic blue print of understanding the purpose of this project - the problem statement so to speak. It is also the blueprint for planning, executing and measuring progress in this project on a meta level. But this project can be described using some additional conceptual models that may be of use.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening is a change in relationship</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a small child eating an ice-cream cone. Thoroughly enjoying it. Imagine the dollop of ice-cream slowly sliding off the cone and landing squarely on the dusty pavement. Getting dirty, melting away. The child will experience tremendous disappointment and probably will start crying. Now we can walk up to the child and console him and perhaps buy him one more ice-cream cone. As parents, guardians of children this is what we do. But now imagine walking up to the kid and telling him that the negative mental states of disappointment, distress, loss that he is feeling comes not from the event itself but from how the kid has related to the event. Beginning with how the kid related to the ice-cream cone believing it to be a reliable source of pleasure, believing his joy at eating it to be permanent and unassailable and his to keep. Laying a claim of ownership on the ice-cream cone, the joy that it gives him, secure in the knowledge that this situation cannot go south. Insist that the kid learns to change this way of relating to the ice-cream cone. Chances are the kid will start bawling even louder :). But that is what Awakening is all about. It is to grok at an experiential level that the way we relate to all of conscious experience is flawed. The inevitable conclusion of this flaw is to keep experiencing negative mental states, or afflictive emotions if you will. It is also to grok at an experiential level that the problem does not get solved by avoiding an ice-cream cone, swearing off it. It doesn’t even get addressed in telling ourselves, talking to ourselves, doing positive thinking and cognitive re-framing of the ice-cream cone. In life, each and everything that makes up our conscious experience is that metaphorical ice-cream cone. Each and everything has the potential of going south.</p>
<p>Death, Old Age, Sickness ….. and Taxes lie in wait for us all! The tax man is particularly brutal! I mean … what the fuck man! Slog your ass off to have 20% of your earnings taken away! But in a more ordinary sense - disappointments … of some sort or the other from some aspect of our lives or the other .. are imminent and keep coming our way - again and again and again … and again. These disappointments cannot be avoided as long as we relate to our lives and the experience of being alive with a claim of ownership and a belief of reliability. As long as our relationship with ‘stuff’ remains the same we are bound to the experience of disappointment and afflictive emotions. This dysfunctional way of relating to the world is ‘samsara’. The cycle of life after life after life …. full of disappointments! A far more functional way of relating to the world is to relax and eventually withdraw the claim of ownership, fully accept the unreliability of things. At which point we experience what is traditionally called ‘Tathata’ in Sanskrit or suchness in English. A full acceptance of life and how it presents itself to us, a full acceptance of how our minds create the experience of our lives. A permanent state of deep engagement with life drawing joy wherever you may find it, taking undesirable outcomes in your stride. A state of mind that is calm and collected, independent of the ups and downs of life.</p>
<p>Adyashanti in an article I had read describes the state of being awakened thus … and I heavily paraphrase … because I don’t remember the source … here:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Someday in the pursuit of awakening you will awaken. You will go for a stroll in a park nearby and a friendly stranger will ask you “Hey dude, how are you?” … and you will answer … “I am doing well, simply can’t complain!”, and on that day there will not be even an iota of untruth in your answer.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The world is what it is, what it has always been. Through The Awakening Project our relationship to it changes. For ever! This change in relationship is awakening. The movement away from Samsara to Tathata is awakening.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening is to grok the nature of conscious experience - Anatma, Anitya</strong></p>
<p>We firmly believe that we exist. A single continuously existing entity that was born on the date of birth stamped on our birth certificate and that will die on the date that is stamped …. well <em>will</em> be stamped … on our death certificate. From the womb to the funeral pyre, the hero of the story.</p>
<p>Through engaging with awakening practices we realize that the sense of self that we carry - a homunculus in the head - pulling levers, exerting control, experiencing angst, jubilation, frustration, satisfaction - is really a construct of the mind. Impersonal mental processes coordinating with each other constantly creating the sense of an entity that is in control. The heroic victor, the defeated victim. The direct experience of this realization of impersonality, of the entirety of conscious experience, as it emerges in awakening practices is called <strong>Anatma in Sanskrit (or Not-Self).</strong></p>
<p>We expect elements in our experience to behave a certain way. We expect good things to happen, bad things to not happen. Or vice versa. We believe our expectations are based on the control that we have. We have control over stuff that makes up our experience of being alive. Thus in our own minds, our expectations are real, justified, and are an accurate assessment of how the details of our lives will flow and how we will experience our lives. This expectation is not just an intellectual evaluation but it is an affective investment. We are affectively invested in the behavior of stuff, things, outcomes, goals, results. It doesn’t matter what our intellectual assessment is, but what is salient is that we attach our heart to that assessment. The problem is we are <strong>not</strong> in control. It’s not that there is no control its that there is no ‘we’. Its not that there is no agency, its that there is no agent. We don’t ‘control’ our perception, cognition, mental models, emotional reactions, cognitive impressions that color future cognition or consciousness itself. In the absence of control over our own cognitive faculties how can we exert control over stuff that we cognize, how can our expectations from our life, our year, our day, our next moment be true and accurate. The direct experience of this flawed expectation of reliability is called <strong>Anitya in Sanskrit (or Unreliability)</strong></p>
<p>If a reader reading this were to completely embrace these concepts, it wont help! As long as we are experientially ignorant of Anatma and Anitya we will keep getting disappointed, keep experiencing cognitive friction, dissatisfaction, and keep experiencing afflictive emotions. This is <strong>Dukkha.</strong></p>
<p>The Awakening Project gives us a direct experiential understanding of Anatma and Anitya - the impersonality and unreliability of conscious experience - thereby delivering us from Dukkha</p>
<p><strong>Awakening is deaddiction from Vedana</strong></p>
<p>Our experience of being alive can be explained as awareness or ‘knowing’ coming into contact (or Sparsh in Sanskrit or Phassa in Pali) with a continuous barrage of ‘objects’. These objects can come to awareness through the 5 sense doors of sight, sound, touch, smell, taste and also through the 6th sense door of the mind in terms of thoughts, emotions, mental states, memories, fantasies, recall of the past, projection or planning for the future etc. Each one of these ‘objects’ can be simple objects like an itch on the elbow or complex objects like the experience of being called upon to give an extempore speech at work or school, or being caressed on the cheek, or slapped in the face. The mind through its learnt experiences tags each of these objects into positive, negative or neutral. This is akin to an electrical charge or valence. This is a sorting exercise that the mind does in order to make sense of the world and relies heavily on accumulated experience. This sorting tag against an object may change - for example the taste of beer, bitter as it is, is rarely considered pleasant by a kid who drinks it for the first time, but as time passes by the taste itself moves away from being sorted as unpleasant to pleasant ….. well …. in most cases.</p>
<p>In and by itself this is a fantastic function of the mind that permits us to navigate our world. We navigate the physical world in terms of avoiding touching a stove while cooking, seeking out the pleasant in terms of food and avoiding the unpleasant in terms of a rotten apple. We navigate the abstract world of societal structures, group hierarchies, professional relationships, familial bonds in terms of seeking out situations that are pleasant and avoiding entering into or creating situations that are unpleasant. This sorting function is an absolute necessity of survival.</p>
<p>The problem with vedana is that we are addicted to it. We are compelled towards positive vedana and away from negative vedana. This compulsion is a strong push that is oftentimes in direct contradiction to rational evaluation. When a smoker stops smoking, they may start snacking in order to get exposure to a substitute positive vedana. People stick earphones and listen to music on buses and trains because they need their daily dose of positive vedana. and they ‘have’ to avoid the negative vedana associated with doing nothing. We cannot be ‘still’ against vedana because of this addiction.</p>
<p>Meditative progress gives us freedom from the addiction and compulsion. This freedom permits choices to emerge from wisdom rather than from compulsion. One who is free of this addiction will never be compelled towards positive vedana or away from negative vedana. One will not cheat, lie, misrepresent in anyway compelled by the addiction to vedana … and by the way that does not mean that one is incapable in any way of lying , cheating or misrepresenting. One will not have to overcome the compulsion of this addiction and suffer the consequences of cognitive friction the way a cigarette smoker has to, every time they try to quit.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening is never again taking ‘birth’</strong></p>
<p>Ordinarily we have a clear distinct memory of who we are. We were born on such and such date, to such and such parents at such and such an address. This is the city we lived in, school we studied at, friends we made, this is the job that we do, and these are the hopes, dreams and aspirations that we have. In the context of The Awakening Project, ‘birth’ means something different, something far more subtle.</p>
<p>Imagine being in the arms of your beloved, hair tousled, light kisses, sweet nothings being whispered in your ear. Some serious amorous adventure is about to follow! Now imagine being in a minor car accident with the other driver jumping out of their car with a tire iron in their hand. Your death, mutilation or injury is imminent. In these two circumstances there are two different entities being born, in two different ‘worlds’. The defining qualities of these two entities, the circumstances within which they find themselves, the emotions and mental states they experience, the cognitive resources available to them, the decision making abilities present …. are vastly different. These two entities are two vastly different people ‘born’ in two vastly different worlds. This is birth. Birth happens in a set pattern. An event, a situation, an interaction, a trigger is where it begins, from there strong pervasive cognitive patterns lead to the creation of an entity in response to the trigger. The process of conception, cell multiplication, embryo, baby … the kicking and screaming … all of it in our simile, is set off by Sparsh or contact carrying Vedana or valence.</p>
<p>The Awakening project involves understanding the process of the creation of this entity and stopping that process completely at vedana. The mind experiences Sparsh, recognizes vedana and then acts on the basis of rationality supported by experiential learning rather than this set pattern of being ‘born’ into a world and then acting in line with the conditions of that particular birth. In this sense Awakening involves the end of rebirth.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening is gaining Knowledge wisdom and dispassion</strong></p>
<p>Whether we posit the presence of latent tendencies or fetters or Sanyojanas as a way of explaining cognitive friction or we define the problem as an addiction to vedana, in either case there are cognitive mechanisms that lead from trigger to suffering. These mechanisms - ‘we’ don’t power them, they are powered by passion that the mind has towards them. The mind sees these mechanisms as necessary for wellbeing and it does not see the consequences of powering them. These mechanisms have been in place and have been practiced over and over again throughout our lives until we have come to believe them to be a core part of who and what we are. The Awakening Project is all about building observational skills and applying them towards these mechanisms. To observe how they operate in direct experience, to see directly the consequences of these mechanisms. To observe that they are just one possible way in which the mind can work. This persistent observation leads to a knowledge of how stuff works in the mind to create Dukkha, it leads to a natural wisdom that is incorporated into the working of the mind as it deals with the contact or Sparsh provided by the world, it also leads to a dispassion towards these mechanisms. The culmination of this collection of knowledge, application of wisdom and building up of dispassion is that all of these mechanisms are slowly de-powered, till they fall silent and eventually simply die off.</p>

<h2>Addressing some misunderstandings about awakening<a class="headerlink" href="#addressing-some-misunderstandings-about-awakening" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Awakening is not about amazeballs experiences</strong></p>
<p>The practices in The Awakening Project require cultivation of certain mental qualities and the gradual fading away of other problematic mental qualities. One of those qualities, to take an example, is a relaxed exclusivity of attention which is a workable translation of the word Samadhi. On the path to gaining Samadhi and maintaining it in formal practice as well as to some extent in daily life, the mind experiences a state which is totally unfamiliar. The hyper distracted mind upon being deprived, due to the practice, of … well distractions … starts to generate its own constructed distractions. Supernovas going off in the visual field, sometimes scary sometimes pleasurable tactile experiences are common. They are a part and parcel of the practice and in and by themselves they have no value .. at all. At best they can be considered a marker of deepening but not yet fully mature Samadhi. This happens in shamatha bhavana as well as vipashyana bhavana where in deep insights into the mind’s workings may arise. But these deep insights are accompanied by these amazeballs experiences and if these experiences capture our fascination then the insights are ignored, a tremendous opportunity is lost.</p>
<p>Imagine a flat earther. Through their own efforts or through the efforts of concerned well wishers, they are miraculously transported to the International Space Station. Its super duper amazing. There’s no gravity, its a novel experience, they get very excited. From the observation window they see the 3D spherical earth in its full majesty. Its ‘earth shattering’, dismay creating but also awe inspiring. This is the gaining of knowledge, facilitated by a shift in perception, accompanied by some extreme powerful and mind blowing states. If the hero of our story does nothing but somersaults in zero gravity yeeting himself from one end of the room to another and completely ignores the observational window, well … OK.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening is not about perceptual changes</strong></p>
<p>Imagine now that our flat earther did in fact avail the opportunity to take a gander through the observation window. Well then they gained insight and the practice was successful. They are then dropped back into their routine mundane village, town or city. For a period of time they will feel super duper special. But what goes up must come down. All the specialness will drain out, there will be nothing special about being them. States come and they go, just like always. The vantage point of perception is back exactly where it was. But for ever and ever, till they die, they now know that the earth isn’t flat. They have gained insight. Their everyday experience of life will keep presenting perceptions of the earth being flat. Nothing about those perceptions have changed! But they know! They have changed, their ‘lineage’ has changed. They have become truth enterers :).</p>
<p>This change in lineage will change behavior, they will be less likely to believe other silly things, less likely to engage in stupid conspiracy theories, more in alignment with their new lineage. They are not special, but their knowledge is rare. The attainment is extraordinary but the person is very very ordinary. Their life is very very ordinary and so is their perception. They don’t see dragons sitting on rocking chairs smoking tobacco filled pipes when they look around their living rooms. They see … their living room … just like everybody else. But all of their preconceptual, preverbal, intellectual assumptions, their cognitive models, that play a role in how they process what they see, are now different. Therefore their affective state moves away from a low grade anxiety which may oftentimes increase, to a low grade relaxation response which may oftentimes deepen even more</p>
<p>Awakening is all about cognitive changes and affective changes that happen because of those cognitive changes. In the Awakening project we do perceptual exercises. We train ourselves to be aware of our left butt-cheeks and to be aware <strong>from</strong> our left butt-cheeks. We train ourselves to see characteristics of experiential objects rather than the objects themselves.</p>
<p>To take an example - we train ourselves to be exclusively attentive to the mosquito buzzing around our ears - thereby deconstructing the knowledge of this mosquito into the fact that there is really a perturbation in awareness from which emerges a recognition that it came through the sense door of hearing, from which emerges a recognition that it is a sound, a sound carrying pitch, tone, volume, from which emerges the classification into the sound of a mosquito from which emerges an image of a mosquito from which emerges the conceptual understanding of a motherfucking blood sucker victimizing us by sucking our blood!!! This is what we train perception to do thereby recognizing the constructed nature of this limited experience and thereby realizing the constructed nature of ALL experience - resulting in <strong>permanent</strong> cognitive changes - resulting in <strong>permanent</strong> affective changes. The perceptual changes … are .. not … permanent.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening is not about becoming ‘moral’ or ‘ethical’</strong></p>
<p>Dukkha does not exist because sometimes we are mean to people. We are mean to people because of Dukkha as one of the potential causes of said meanness. Dukkha leads to dis-functional irrational behavior which sometimes breaks social norms. The source of Dukkha, its root cause has nothing to do with consensus morality or commonly accepted codes of ethical conduct. Morality is a social construct. We are a part of society, if we violate these social constructs we will experience consequences that carry negative vedana. To have a booming successful business - carries positive vedana. To have your business ‘cancelled’ because you called some placard carrying vegan chick with an agenda and an attitude a snowflake on twitter or reddit - carries negative vedana. Don’t do stupid shit. Don’t be a dick - as an end in itself this is a fantastic goal. While practicing ‘not being a dick’ please remember that its connection to the Awakening Project is very very tenuous and tangential.</p>
<p>The social norms that exist are applicable to everybody including the ones who are awakened. There is nothing special or sacrosanct about these norms. They are an imposition to keep people in line so that society functions smoothly delivering mostly positive societal outcomes through the peace and order that these norms create. Some of these norms get codified into law particularly when they are deemed crucial to general peace. And some of these norms are straight up perverted! Ages ago abortion would be considered immoral, then for some time it wasn’t, now I understand that there are places on this planet where a woman getting an abortion out of choice would be considered a crime! It comes with a jail sentence! The law is an ass! So is a consensus based morality!</p>
<p>But as a member of society we the awakened or the one’s engaged in awakening practices have to take cognizance of boundaries and constraints on behavior. Don’t cuckold your neighbor! He may come after you to bash you on the head with a baseball bat as you sit under a bodhi tree meditating on formless realms. Then where will you be? If that doesn’t happen the fear of such a consequence will prevent optimal practice. If not fear then some strange guilt, regret, remorse will torture the mind and prevent any kind of Bhavana. So … don’t cuckold your neighbor! In order to be plainly street smart and guard your mind from the negative consequences of your actions you don’t need any code of conduct that you swear on! Hold a spirit of friendship in your heart, a desire to help people, a desire to not hurt people. Practice just this simple thing. And you are good to get started. Eventually as The Awakening Project does its job, you will realize that this simple principle of being friendly and helpful is a natural outcome of awakening any which way.</p>
<p>That big juicy steak! … don’t worry about it homie, dig in! There is no need to buy into somebody else’s definitions of what is right and wrong. A solitary vegan chick should just be ignored. Of course if there is the possibility that a mob of vegan chicks will show up at your doorstep to lynch you, or if the police will arrest you if you devour that animal … don’t eat it … eat something else. Respect the mob! Respect the law! :) :)</p>
<p><strong>Awakening is not about exchanging your Lamborghini for a begging bowl</strong></p>
<p>Awakening practices got developed by sages, monks, hermits, sadhus in ancient times. During those times these practices were also taught exclusively by them. Sage, monk, hermit, sadhu … these are professions or vocations just like lawyer, doctor, accountant. They are dedicated professions and dedicating one’s self to those professions opens up a lot of time and energy needed to finish the project. But time and energy needed varies vastly amongst people. The project itself doesn’t care what your profession is. You may have an accountant who may have the talent necessary to apply themselves within their lives for an hour or so everyday for a few years (maybe decades) and awaken. You may have a sage living in a Himalayan cave who may have the talent necessary to apply themselves for an hour or so everyday for a few years (maybe decades) and gain a CFA certification.</p>
<p>In order to do these practices and gain freedom from suffering you need to apply yourself with consistency and dedication in a very structured and methodical way. You do not need to exchange your Lamborghini for a begging bowl. Maybe someone is completely untalented and has no choice but to move to the Himalayas - but unless we apply ourselves consistently in a structured and methodical way for a few years at least - we have no way of knowing this. For the time being - keep your Lamborghini. As long as part of your profession you aren’t murdering puppies, torturing kittens, conning pensioners, kidnapping children for ransom, dealing in blood diamonds, smuggling cocaine … and such like … you are good!</p>
<p>The broad principle of the arbitrariness, and sometimes silliness, of consensus morality and socially emergent ethical conduct applies to profession as well. If you work in an abattoir or a meat packing business and have been at peace with yourself - don’t let the nutty vegan chicks hassle you. Guard your mind against such unskillful nonsense. But if during the course of The Awakening Project you discover that your job actually causes a lot of mental turmoil, which you weren’t aware of - well you may have to change your job. And that too is a ‘may’.</p>
<p><strong>OK - lets bite the bullet and talk about sex</strong></p>
<p>Uncle Sid had some kind of obsessive objection to sex. He once berated a student who had gone home for a visit to his aged parents or something like that and had a quickie with his wife.</p>
<p>Uncle Sid .. if this story is true … was an idiot!</p>
<p>Sir Issac Newton was perhaps amongst the most brilliant scientific minds that has ever existed. He also believed that he had discovered the secrets of the philosopher’s stone and could convert lead into gold and spent days weeks and months pursuing this utter fascination that he had. Pythagoras was perhaps amongst the most gifted mathematicians ever. He was also a cult leader and completely believed that he was a demigod. He had rules for everything - for example he instituted a rule in his cult that everybody must wear their right shoes first … as in always … else they would be expelled from the cult. He also believed that bodily fluids contain ‘power’ … particularly semen and insisted that his cult members always abstain. Both of these people were brilliant! … geniuses! worthy of our respect for the simple fact that they existed and walked amongst us. Great minds have very very very unusual fascinations. They are eccentric. But if one wanted to learn geometry one should have the stability and clarity of mind needed to understand that the ‘right shoe rule’ was dumb, stupid and completely silly. And that semen retention has nothing to do with calculating the length of the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle!</p>
<p>If one wanted to learn the art and craft of studying perception and apperception and gaining knowledge, and wisdom regarding how suffering is created in the mind, one should have the good horse sense to know what is useful and appropriate as opposed to what is silly and completely tangential to the objective one has set for themselves. Sadly such grounded-ness is missing. If you consider the awakening project. Most of us aren’t gifted! Thus most of us are going to take 7 years rather that 7 weeks in order to finish the fucking job. Most of us will have to invest thousands of hours in this pursuit. The people who would really roll up their sleeves and put their back into this are people who have experienced a certain minimum degree of suffering in their lives. Such people come to this brilliantly conceived practice popularized by a brilliant brilliant man and buy into all of it! … all of it! Thus the fascination with Sid and his eccentricities is understandable. In any case when it comes to matters of spirituality the first thing people (mostly men) think about is the ding dong dangling between their legs. It gives so much pleasure … surely there must be something wrong with this scheme of things! :)</p>
<p>My suggestion is … don’t be an idiot .. keep up the bedroom action … don’t keep up the bedroom action … it is all about personality, quirkiness, superstitious nonsense and has nothing whatsoever to do with The Awakening Project.</p>
<p>On that note we move on to the next chapter.</p>
