<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>A friend and student of mine is working at attaining to shrotapanna. This post is a ready reckoner for him to refer to in order to inform his practice and help him plan and execute the techniques that free.</p>

<p><strong>Fetters</strong></p>
<p>Cognitive compulsions that push the citta - the heart-mind, into certain positions. These positions are experienced with ubiquitous commonality across people/minds and thus a shared language has emerged to describe the positions. The fetters have no name, they take their name from these commonly experienced positions. They are 10 in number. But this is a mere convenience in terms of efficiency of ‘modeling’. This list of 10 is MECE - mutually exclusive and cumulatively exhaustive. Therein lies Uncle Sid’s sheer genius. A problem so well defined that it becomes relatively easier to solve it. To read more about them all please check out <a class="reference internal" href="../awakeningproject/chapter1.html#awakeningprojectfetters"><span class="std std-ref">this</span></a> post. In this ready reckoner though, we will concern ourselves with the first three fetters. Sat-kaya drishti, Sila-vrat paramarsh, vi-chikitsa.</p>
<p>To fully understand how these fetters are laid out and to deeply appreciate the problem solving/ mental training/skill building/investigation techniques that free, that lead to the uprooting of the first three its useful to think in the following way:</p>
<p>We are ignorant of the two marks of existence (or ‘lakshan’)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Anitya - unreliability</p></li>
<li><p>Not Self - Anatma</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Our ignorance of the two marks of existence keeps alive the latent cognitive tendencies that push us into a world of suffering - Dukkha. This happens sense contact by sense contact, moment by moment, day by day … year by year of our lives.</p>
<p><strong>The first three fetters</strong></p>
<p>The hallmark of the first three fetters is the desperate search for reliability. We want our conscious experience to be reliable!</p>
<p>Sat-kaya drishti - We want to clearly know who we are! - I am … ‘x’. I am a man … oozing with machismo. I am a yogi … oozing with my ill understood second hand knowledge of Uncle Sid’s ‘teachings’. I am a theravadan …. those tibetan fellas … hah!!!</p>
<p>Sila-vrat paramarsh - In order to make my life predictable I will figure out strange positions and rituals structured around those positions and ‘follow’ them. I will go to the gym everyday and thus I will never ever ever lose these sexy rippling muscles. In order to make my practice predictable I will memorize and spout Sutras and only the ones from the early texts … the later ones ….. pfffffffttttt</p>
<p>Vichikitsa - In order to ensure that my life, my sense of being alive predictable and safe I will imagine all sorts of strange problems and butt my head against them - real or made up … doesn’t matter. Am I doing this kettle bell swing right? Is this gym instructor the right gym instructor for me, those crossfit guys seem to be making a lot of gains! look at these guns … why aren’t they getting bigger? My practice isn’t going anywhere, am I ‘following’ the right ‘teachings’? Is this the right teacher for me? is this the right practice program …. those advait vedant dudes seem really chill, I want what they are smoking. We just can’t be still!!! We just can’t sit peacefully on our commute to work without hassling ourselves over whether we actually locked our front door or are misremembering having locked it.</p>
<p>Think of each fetter that leads to a potential cage - upon receiving sense contact there is a set sequence or pattern of mental actions that lead to the heart being stuffed into that cage. The sequence or patterns of mental actions is very very predictable in its nature - its called Dependent Origination. Think of DO as a dry desolate factory - it has no richness - its just a pattern. This pattern is given richness and colour and flavor by the details of our lives as it unfolds - sense contact and terminate and stay resident programs that kick into action upon sense contact and start to churn the gears of the factory .. feeding it with details - samskaras or sankharas.</p>
<p>For example one may have learnt through life experience that one should never let a bully walk away without bloodying his nose - this is a sankhara. Upon coming into contact with a bully - sense contact, the sankhara kicks into action. The richness of the sense contact and the sankhara adds colour to the process and outcome of the specific set of events that lead to taking birth as the guy who must now defend himself or die trying. The hallmark of the process and its final outcome is the involvement of the citta or the heart-mind … affective investments, emotional entanglement.</p>
<p>Through your practice you have worked on an action plan that builds knowledge, wisdom and dispassion towards these fetters, the DO pattern, the sankharas, the end outcome. It is this knowledge of how shit works, wisdom of managing the mind and dispassion. It is dispassion towards all of this subtle but profound, powerful but useless cognitive activity that frees the mind from it. This dispassion or nibbida is like a force of nature - very powerful but completely blind to collateral damage. Its supposed to dismantle the tendency to take birth as the guy who must get a promotion at work … and it ends up shoving the guy into a monastery with a begging bowl in hand or in a forest eating wild taters. Your action plan needs to factor in this brute force strength of nibbida.</p>

<p><strong>Your practice</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The factors of awakening of mindfulness, energy, concentration, investigation are very highly developed</p></li>
<li><p>The factors of tranquility, equanimity … they come and go</p></li>
<li><p>The mind has a certain grabby-ness, it tries to grab the jhanas. This is the reason that you are unable to reliably move from jhana 1 to jhana 2. This grabby-ness is not gross its very subtle. the reason its so subtle is because of your excellent concentration. You can hold on to one object and thus let go of all others, but the grabby-ness shows up to the priti that arises. This requires a lot of softening into a lot of letting go. It requires the yogi to totally relax (tranquility) and let go of the affective investment in the success of the meditation itself (equanimity) - and then each jhana will arise and jhana mastery becomes possible</p></li>
<li><p>You are cycling in the Progress of insight</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Emptiness - all of conscious experience is ‘assembled’</p></li>
<li><p>Unreliability - nothing in conscious experience can be relied upon</p></li>
<li><p>Dukkha - Unreliability and a lack of acceptance … sucks</p></li>
<li><p>Anatma - Some degree of equanimity arises, affective investment is withdrawn, the heart is no longer thrust into the conceptual cages formed by the fetters</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li><p>This cycling will continue until you develop the factors of tranquility and equanimity. Both will come about in the process of the cycling itself. sooner or later the mind will ‘give up’ and stop doing the stuff that bumps you back into a previous stage of the PoI.</p></li>
<li><p>Very very intentional planned methodical samadhi skill development combined with a very very intentional planned investigation execution is the way forward</p></li>
<li><p>Practice has to become very structured and methodical - the citta / heart-mind has to settle down and accept the experiential insights that are arising. This will happen organically by keeping on keeping on … but its like a throw of dice. We can load the dice in our favor by identifying and working on skills in isolation and combination</p></li>

<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>You have made great progress so far</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘grind’ is getting to you - its leading to vichikitsa regarding the practice. All the cycling is possibly causing a sense of failure and associated stress. You aren’t failing - this is a part and parcel of the awakening project. The stress has to be countered by doing sufficient tranquility in practice on and off the cushion</p></li>
<li><p>Work with patience and intentionally be very methodical on the cushion as well as off the cushion - in practice as well as in planning and reviewing your practice</p></li>
<li><p>Make weekly / fortnightly plans - what are you going to work on - log your sits</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of the planning period - review your log and plan the next period. Factor in practice technique changes that correct for imbalances like insufficient tranquility, gaps in investigation techniques etc.</p></li>
<li><p>What seems like a daunting project - split up into chunks (weekly/fortnightly) helps the mind actually settle down and do the techniques. It is the technique that frees and not the aspiration for freedom. Aspiration for freedom is great! but left undirected it turns into a fire that burns the mind. In reviewing and planning give the mind what it needs in terms of accepting and acknowledging that aspiration. In the executing of the plan - settle down and get deeply interested in the execution. This is the way!</p></li>
