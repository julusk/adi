<h1>Practices to balance attention and awareness - Relief from head pressure and coarse piti<a class="headerlink" href="#practices-to-balance-attention-and-awareness-relief-from-head-pressure-and-coarse-piti" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>In my practice I faced difficulties, which later through personal experience I understood as happening, due to an imbalance between the power of attention versus awareness. I was consistently powering attention without balancing awareness. The two problems I had were:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Head pressure</p></li>
<li><p>Jolts of powerful pleasurable sensations running up and down my spine - a form of coarse piti</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Both of these things happening on and <strong>off the cushion</strong> (as well) were barely tolerable to me at times and sometimes absolutely unwanted. I know that there are ‘awakening models’ which value and encourage such a situation under the assumption that its part of the developmental arc towards awakening. Though I have no structured arguments with that paradigm, my own crude thinking does not align well with such models. And so I wanted a ‘fix’.</p>
<p>Through working in the TMI instruction set I understood the need to strengthen awareness in lock step with attention leading to a healthy balance between the two. TMI is very rigorous in all aspects. The book gives the necessary instructions to do this but it does not spend a lot of time on detailed practice tips dealing with such a problem. But through TMI I learnt that I needed to and could fix this. In online literature on meditation I did not find a clear action plan or practice plan in order to deal with this and so I experimented with practice techniques to find a way of creating balance. This post describes what worked for me.</p>
<p>I have written the post in a direct language in the form of an instruction set because its an easier writing style. But please know that I do not consider myself an expert at practice and I certainly am not a scholar of theory. My request to you, the reader, would be to use your own knowledge and judgement in evaluating my suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Generally applicable instructions:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The three practices below set up different tasks for attention so that you can train the faculty of awareness to become stronger in different settings. After having tried my suggestions, feel free to improvise for yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Do this in a seated posture on the floor or on a chair (you can also do this lying down provided you know how to correct for dullness). While seated your hands should be in your lap - one on top of the other creating a clear touch point.</p></li>
<li><p>Concern yourself with the mental factors of Mindfulness (remember continuously - here you are and this is what you are doing), Tranquility (deep relaxation), Investigation (strongly held attitude of curiosity as to whats happening in your mind). Of the above three the most important is Investigation, make sure that you maintain a robust attitude of deep curiosity about whats going on overall in your mind.</p></li>
<li><p>Concentration naturally develops with the instructions. Be unconcerned about Joy, equanimity, energy - they will take care of themselves</p></li>
<li><p>At the outset, do slow deep belly breathing. Relax body and mind on the out breath letting go of tension in the body and readiness / vigilance / agitation in the mind. Do this to the degree that you don’t feel sleepy. (You can also do metta or chanting or anything else that works best for you and helps you settle down)</p></li>
<li><p>At any point of time while following the instructions you feel that you are no longer relaxed, just drop whatever you are doing, don’t bother about losing momentum, and do some more deep belly breathing.</p></li>
<li><p>The instruction set I suggest will take some <strong>trial and error</strong> - you may not see early results towards the stated objective. You are still working with the manipulation of attention and thus are still contributing towards the awakening project while trying to gain a new skill.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Practice 1 - Attention stable on the touch of the hands:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Take stock of everything that makes up your conscious experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Slowly luxuriously move attention around to all the sense doors, letting go of one, moving on to the next. Working with various objects as they become prominent. Take your time.</p></li>
<li><p>Come back to an open awareness with attention freely moving between sense doors and objects, let them ‘self select’</p></li>
<li><p>You are doing all of this to encourage and gain momentum of mindfulness and investigation and get a handle on attention</p></li>
<li><p>Restrict the scope of attention to the sense door of the body</p></li>
<li><p>Gently place your attention on the touch of your hands - notice softness, hardness, warmth, coolness, friction, motion - basically get deeply interested in every elemental quality you can find within that touch</p></li>
<li><p>Stay on that touch till you feel that attention has stabilized to a high degree</p></li>
<li><p>Intend strongly to keep attention stable and at the same time intend to be increasingly aware that you have a body and there are sensory inputs coming from the body (which you should not pay attention to, just let them come, don’t look for them)</p></li>
<li><p>If you are very mindful, very investigative and if you have practiced whats called MIA (meta-cognitive introspective awareness) within the TMI paradigm, you will notice whether you are getting a sense of the rest of your body through awareness or whether attention is rapidly zipping around, moving grossly or subtly flickering in order to build a picture of the rest of your body. If you don’t have sufficient MIA, then intend to notice this movement of attention in case it is happening, trial and error will give you a full flavor of MIA. Stabilize attention using intentions in conjunction with MIA and continue to notice your body without moving attention</p></li>
<li><p>You may keep softly saying to yourself - “There is a body” - softly and infrequently mind you :). Its not supposed to become a chant</p></li>
<li><p>Very soon you will have a clear sense of foreground and background - the touch of your hands in the foreground - itches, aches, pains, warmth, coolness, heaviness, motion etc from the rest of your body in the background</p></li>
<li><p>Deliberately try and notice less detail about the foreground and more detail about the background. In this intention lies the result of reducing ‘power’ from attention and re-routing to awareness</p></li>
<li><p>Just see how far you can go - can you reduce attention to a mere sliver and power awareness a lot more - I find this very relaxing, so don’t fall asleep :)</p></li>
<li><p>Do the above steps with the sense doors of hearing as well as the sense door of the mind (thoughts, feelings, emotions) individually</p></li>
<li><p>Do the above steps with multiple and all sense doors at the same time - keeping attention on the touch of the hands and increasing the clarity of the background across one or all sense doors</p></li>
<li><p>In moving power to favor awareness keep an eye on head pressure or harsh piti in your spine - hopefully it will reduce for you just the way it does for me - fingers crossed :) !</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Practice 2 - Attention moving between touch points:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The touch of your hands, the touch of your lips, the touch of your eyelids, the touch of each buttock on the floor, the touch of each thigh on the floor, the touch of each ankle on the floor - are all touch points - 10 in all</p></li>
<li><p>Of these touch points select a few which are clear and distinct for you</p></li>
<li><p>In a set pre-determined sequence move attention intentionally between these touch points, staying on each for just a short while - slowly increasing the speed of movement without losing tranquility</p></li>
<li><p>When you reach a certain steady cadence while ensuring relaxation and tranquility - just keep it up.</p></li>
<li><p>Use MIA to know the feeling of attention moving intentionally versus unintended movements and try and reduce unintended movements</p></li>
<li><p>While doing these movements - now repeat the steps above in practice 1 of powering down attention and powering up awareness at one, multiple, every sense door</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Practice 3 - Attention steady on a mental image or a physical Kasina:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Bring to mind a simple visual - I use a bright blue circular outline on a bright white background</p></li>
<li><p>Stabilize this visual and deeply engage attention with it</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the steps above in practice 1 to power down attention and power up awareness</p></li>
<li><p>If this is too complex, open your eyes and use an actual physical visual object - the simpler the better</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Wrapping up instructions:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The raw mechanics of the practice is of less importance than the mental factor of investigation. Be very very observant with whatever is going on. If you get a good sense of how you are moving power of consciousness between the two different modes of ‘knowing’ then you can remember and can simply incline your mind a certain way and things just happen, you don’t need to follow a rigid instruction set! This is really the whole point to doing this in a structured mechanical way</p></li>
<li><p>To keep a sense of whats happening with head pressure or coarse piti in the spine is very important. You need to treat this as a bio-feedback mechanism telling you to make corrections.</p></li>
<li><p>The reason I don’t suggest breath at the nostrils (TMI style) to practice this skill is because I personally find the breath to be absolutely fascinating with a lot of potential for simply getting absorbed into it and thus not suitable for this deliberate practice. Your experience might be different</p></li>
<li><p>Do this practice the way a tennis player would carry five buckets of tennis balls on to the court in order to do drills on a single serve technique - over and over again. Repetition should yield results. Sadly for me any new skill takes time and if it does for you too then know that this digression doesn’t take anything away from the awakening project</p></li>
<li><p>Once learnt you need to port this skill to your own practice as well as off the cushion activities letting awareness go far and wide and powerful while manipulating attention the way you need to. Whether you are doing Noting, TMI, Driving a car, Dinner with friends etc, this skill ports as long as you encourage it by intentionally applying it in different contexts</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Hope this post helps you. If you try this then do write back to me on how it worked for you.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
