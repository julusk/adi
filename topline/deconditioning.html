<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>MIDL (Mindfulness in Daily Life) is an insight meditation system based upon the Satipatthana Sutra. Its taught by an Australian teacher - Stephen Procter. The MIDL system requires the development of three pillars - flexible attention; softening into; stillness. While developing these three pillars as foundational skills, the system takes the meditator through the four foundations of mindfulness. One of the practices within this system is that of ‘deconditioning emotional charge’ associated with memories, events, circumstances etc. This post details out my understanding of this practice. Beginning with the way its taught and moving on to the way it has evolved for me.</p>
<p>Though I am an advocate of this system, I do not claim any kind of expertise certainly not the kind that’s required to teach. Any mistakes or errors in understanding of the practice are my own and have happened despite my best intentions and efforts.</p>

<h2>The skill of ‘softening into’<a class="headerlink" href="#the-skill-of-softening-into" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The MIDL pillar / skill of softening into experience needs to be very strong in order to engage with this exercise. Different systems and teachers may teach the same thing in different ways and names but for the sake of this post I will stick to the terminology of MIDL (to the extent that I understand it).</p>
<p>As meditators all of us know the intrusion of pain, itches, random memories that seem urgent in the moment (shit I forgot to pay my credit card bill). MIDL uses the natural relaxation of the body to teach the mind how to relax in the face of such events that in the moment seem compelling but actually aren’t. Deep slow abdominal breathing, gentle sighing through the nose, lifting and putting down parts of the body and letting the physical relaxation enter the mind in the form of a ‘letting be’ … and therefore a ‘letting go’ of these fake compulsions is essentially the skill of ‘softening into’. When one softens into experience one does not want to change the experience itself but one is interested in changing the relationship that one has with experience. Any adverse experience becomes just one more presentation of the mind. If equanimity is a mental factor then ‘softening into’ is one way of getting there event by event, experience by experience.</p>

<section id="the-practice">
<h2>The Practice<a class="headerlink" href="#the-practice" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Here’s a link to a soundcloud file guided meditation on this practice in case anybody’s interested in looking directly at the original rather than my recalled description (which may have errors).</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://soundcloud.com/user-677685629/midl-mindfulness-training-2352-deconditioning-emotional-charge">https://soundcloud.com/user-677685629/midl-mindfulness-training-2352-deconditioning-emotional-charge</a></p>
<p>The guided meditation starts and ends with positive memories, but that is not the core objective of this exercise. That is just a teaching tool used to give a soft start and a soft landing to the meditator who does not have a lot of experience with this exercise. The exercise primarily is interested in the harshness of life situations, memories, people etc.</p>
<p>The steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Take a couple of deep breaths and put one hand in the other in your lap, creating a clear touch point</p></li>
<li><p>Spend some time with the sensory experience of the five sense doors. four if your eyes are closed.</p></li>
<li><p>Ground yourself in the sense door of the body. Appreciating that your whole body is heavy, it touches the chair or the cushion and it gives sensory data of temperature changes all the time. These are preliminaries that boost the mental factors of mindfulness, concentration and investigation.</p></li>
<li><p>Move to the touch of your hands and stay on the touch of your hands being closely attentive to every physical sensation that you can notice. Hardness, softness, coolness, warmth, friction, motion … everything. This acts as an anchor and while being attentive to the anchor notice that the mind is still busy creating your world around you. But the anchor grounds you to the present moment and in the present moment there is only safety and clarity. Because thoughts are just thoughts, mental states are just mental states while ‘you’ concern yourself only with your anchor.</p></li>
<li><p>Let go of the anchor and bring up a harsh memory. Its a good idea to think of some memories beforehand which you know bother you, but they aren’t so bad as to send you into any kind of extremely anxious mental states or panic.</p></li>
<li><p>Against the memory which you try to hold in your mind clearly and distinctly, notice that there are other thoughts, judgements, mental states, emotions that are triggered by that memory. Keep the memory fresh in your mind somewhere in the periphery of awareness.</p></li>
<li><p>Mental states and emotions in the mind have physical counterparts. The body reflects the state of the mind. Notice the ‘objects’ in the body that are correlated to the harsh emotions, mental states. Amongst these objects in the body place your attention on the dominant sensations. Could be tightness in your chest, could be a lump in your throat, could be a heavy hard feeling inside your abdomen. Keep the memory fresh in your mind somewhere in the periphery of awareness.</p></li>
<li><p>Notice that this physical object has negative vedana or valence attached to it. Keep the memory fresh in your mind somewhere in the periphery of awareness.</p></li>
<li><p>Place your attention on that vedana and use slow deep gentle abdominal breathing to soften into that vedana. To change your relationship with that vedana. to stop rejecting that vedana and to permit it to just be!</p></li>
<li><p>As you continue to soften into the vedana the strength of the vedana decreases, the body relaxes, the mental states settle down the thoughts become increasingly neutral and commentarial rather than judgmental and adverse.</p></li>
<li><p>Come back to the anchor, the touch of your hands and stay there for a while</p></li>
<li><p>Keep going back to the same memory that you worked with and do the exercise until the memory does not trigger the same reactions at least not with the same strength.</p></li>
<li><p>This can be done with multiple memories.</p></li>
<li><p>In learning the skill take the time to just working with the same memory again and again. Once learnt the process is faster and you could address multiple memories in the same sit.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>How the practice has evolved for me over time<a class="headerlink" href="#how-the-practice-has-evolved-for-me-over-time" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>When I work with a trigger like a memory I am able to detect directly the vedana associated with that memory. The vedana associated with the thoughts that come up. the vedana associated with the emotions or mental states and the vedana associated with the reactions in the body</p></li>
<li><p>Against the memory itself I can see that the vedana (unpleasant) leads to a preference (don’t want this). The preference leads to a hard stand. The hard stand leads to the clear distinct cluster of phenomena which tell me that this bad experience is happening to me and <strong>I don’t like it</strong>!</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘I don’t like it’ triggers a multitude of cascading effects that completely infect the mind in every which way. Why me? Why always me? Why not my next door neighbor? :)</p></li>
<li><p>In practice I create a very calm still pool of water. And into it I drop the pebble of a memory, the same memory again and again (in great visual and auditory detail) which creates a standing wave of ripples in line with #2 above.Edit: I mean this as an analogy :)</p></li>
<li><p>I begin softening into this from the very end - the chaos, the dukkha rather than the vedana of the original memory. And I work my way backwards to the vedana of the trigger and I address it in the end.</p></li>
<li><p>I see this exercise as a tour of the 4 foundations of mindfulness, a study of Dependent Origination, A detailed study of how vedana leads to craving/aversion and the method of stopping the cascade at vedana</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>End notes<a class="headerlink" href="#end-notes" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>We do vipashyana on ‘objects’. The deconstructed nuts and bolts of conscious experience, the ‘vibrations’. This practice takes all of those skills learnt and then applies the skills on ‘compound objects’. The ‘compound objects’ that comprise our everyday conscious lived experience and in that sense this practice works very well in carrying over of ‘Mindfulness in daily life’. This is currently a big part of my practice.</p></li>
<li><p>Deliberately choose memories that aren’t very harsh. If you have ever been in a life threatening situation for example - that’s not a good choice … unless you are adventurous and really skillful</p></li>
<li><p>You can choose memories from different contexts, interpersonal relationships at work, at home, with friends. Life events of adversity like flunking an exam, being rejected at a job interview. Anything can be a good subject</p></li>
<li><p>In practice I often use phrases which carry a lot of meaning as ‘pebbles’ to drop into the ‘still pool’. Edit: I mean this as an analogy :). ‘I am a failure’, ‘I will never do well’, Profit, Loss, fame, blame, shame, pride, humiliation. This practice once learnt is very flexible.</p></li>
<li><p>The mind learns in categories of experience. What I mean is if, for example, you have worked a lot with memories of interpersonal conflict at work, then as interpersonal conflict at work arises the mind does what it learnt to do …. on the fly … you just have to encourage it a bit by being mindful</p></li>
<li><p>This practice does not lead to becoming a zombie with zero ‘affect’ in case you the reader are wondering :). This practices leads to reduced compulsions of habituated mental movements / thought processes / behavioral patterns. It hasn’t led to me losing my marbles … at least not yet. :)</p></li>
<li><p>For me this practice has been very rewarding. The kind of stillness and clarity that gets generated in a longish session on the cushion segues beautifully well off the cushion.</p></li>
<li><p>This is currently my ‘go to’ practice for understanding how vedana leads to craving and how to stop cooperating!</p></li>
</ol>
