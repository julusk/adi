<section id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This is the second part to this post. the second in a three part series of posts. Part three to come later.</p>
<p>Insight practices usually develop sensitivity to the three marks of existence in the sequence of Anitya-Dukkha-Anatma - from the gross to the subtle. But there is nothing sacrosanct about this sequence. Practice can be deliberately structured towards developing sensitivity towards Anatma. Insights into Anatma are what makes the experience of Dukkha and the process of gaining knowledge of Dukkha an impersonal and therefore mostly tolerable experience. The mind meditates, the mind understands how it creates dukkha, makes necessary corrections, eventually learns how to end dukkha … once and for all! The Yogi gets out of the way. This part of the post series deals with this deliberate structuring.</p>
<p>I am not a teacher, not an expert. I heavily reference <a class="reference external" href="https://midlmeditation.com.au/">MIDL</a> and TMI - systems of practice that I have used, but have no authorization, acknowledgement, explicit or tacit permission from the creators of those systems. I am very very technique oriented. For me practice is all about sets and reps. Such a style of practice does not suit everybody. Caveat Emptor :).</p>

<section id="required-skills">
<h2>Required skills<a class="headerlink" href="#required-skills" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The entirety of this path is an act of building skills and an act of using those skills to investigate conscious experience. The investigation can happen in the skill building itself, conversely the skill building can happen in the investigation. Very recursive, I don’t like it! :) The skills that I write about here are those that I think are needed to progress. Engaging one’s self with these skills is highly rewarding.</p>
<p><strong>Smriti/sati and its application in investigation</strong></p>
<p>In investigation of conscious experience, the act of creating a verbal label needs to move on to the act of creating a non verbal label onwards to the act of creating an intentional mindful pause in the movements of attention onwards to the act of simply permitting objects to be held and released from short term working memory. The use of smriti without taking such clumsy pauses and flow disrupting cognitive activity is an important skill. Aspirational yes, but beyond a point - needed for finishing ‘the job’.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Take 4 to 5 long deep abdominal breaths, settle down properly into your posture and hold the knowledge in your mind that ‘I am just sitting here’. That’s it, that’s all you need to do in this step. You may notice body sensations, experience an ear-worm in your mind, plan your dinner, regret your life decisions - it doesn’t matter - as long as you clearly and distinctly remember … moment by moment … that ‘I am just sitting here’. This is the fairly challenging training of smriti or mindfulness.</p></li>
<li><p>All you hold deliberately and intentionally in short term working memory is the fact - I am just sitting here. Initially a verbal sentence, then a non verbal / non visual marker, then empty out the marker. It doesn’t need a marker</p></li>
<li><p>As awareness engages with objects simply know - “one more presentation of the mind”. There is an itch on your ass - one more presentation of the mind. There is sound of a dog barking - one more presentation of the mind. There is a thought ‘I am meditating’ - one more presentation of the mind. There is a day dream where you plan vengeance on your sibling who screwed you out of your inheritance - one more presentation of the mind. No labels, no notes, no pauses. I am just sitting here and ‘this’ is one more presentation of the mind</p></li>
<li><p>Permit the mind to hold the presentation in short term working memory thus holding three things at once - I am just sitting here, one more presentation of the mind, and ‘this’ presentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t intentionally structure awareness in any way whatsoever, don’t direct awareness to create a subject-object relationship -that happens on its own. Keep relaxing the desire to do any deliberate structuring. Simply hold 3 things in short term working memory at the same time - (1) I am just sitting here (2) One more presentation of the mind (3) The presentation itself</p></li>
<li><p>Add in a recognition of which sense door the presentation comes from, add in a recognition of the category of object within the sense door. Touch - itch, pain, heat, movement etc. Sound - harsh, soft, near, far etc and so on</p></li>
<li><p>Cramming data into short term working memory and releasing it seamlessly - no labels, no conceptual markers, no pauses</p></li>
<li><p>Finally to ramp up the complexity - as if it weren’t already complex - remember that you are remembering all of these things, be aware that you are aware, be attentive to the fact that you are paying attention - I know … very recursive</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Mindfulness of thoughts and the thinking process</strong></p>
<p>The entirety of <a class="reference internal" href="thoughts.html#thinking"><span class="std std-ref">this</span></a> post is of salience. Of particular interest is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Ability to recognize and categorize thoughts into - Visual, auditory and meaning based (neither visual not auditory)</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to recognize and categorize thoughts into - Random, Habitual, Driven by emotional charge, narration, deliberate/intentional. More on narration based thoughts - later</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>MIA</strong></p>
<p>To deliberately increase the binding moments of consciousness in awareness thus creating a narrative or story of ‘The Mind’. A narrative that is available on an ongoing basis like the running commentary in a cricket match. ‘The mind is joyous’, ‘The mind is expansive’, ‘The mind is constricted’, ‘The mind is unsettled’ … etc. This running commentary runs parallel to the mechanism of attention pointed at an object.</p>
<p><strong>Vi-Pashyana</strong></p>
<p>To Be aware of an object while being aware of awareness itself. A bidirectional arrow of attention. Bullet point #8 above</p>

<p id="softening"><strong>Softening into</strong></p>
<p>Softening into is a skill taught within the MIDL system, it takes the natural relaxation of the body and uses that to teach the mind non-resistance to experience onwards to non-participation with experience, onwards to withdrawing the claim of ownership on that particular experience as well as withdrawing the claim of ownership on the entirety of conscious experience as well as the act of experiencing itself. There are multiple trainings within MIDL that teach this skill. Here are links to guided meditations: <a class="reference external" href="https://midlmeditation.com.au/insight-meditation-12">1</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://midlmeditation.com.au/insight-meditation-13">2</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://midlmeditation.com.au/insight-meditation-14">3</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://midlmeditation.com.au/insight-meditation-15">4</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://midlmeditation.com.au/insight-meditation-16">5</a></p>
<p>To elaborate on one particular technique - Creating and Dropping of Intentions</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Get settled and do a familiar practice that fires up the engines of mindfulness, concentration and investigation</p></li>
<li><p>Decide to lift your left arm … but don’t lift it</p></li>
<li><p>Notice the physical tension that gathers in your left arm</p></li>
<li><p>On the next outbreath … relax your left arm</p></li>
<li><p>Do this a couple of times, start to notice that just the way there is a gathering of tension in the left arm, there is a gathering of ‘intention’ in the mind</p></li>
<li><p>On releasing the tension, notice that the intention is also released in the mind - take a pause and sink awareness deeply within this release - learn what it means to release a mental object</p></li>
<li><p>Apply the same process to the right arm, eyelids, eyebrows, jaw, shoulders, legs etc</p></li>
<li><p>Apply the skill of dropping intention towards any intention that arises taking a pause to sink awareness in the dropping of as well as absence of intention</p></li>
<li><p>Apply this skill of dropping intentions towards anything that shows up in mediation - an itch, a mosquito bite, a harsh memory .. etc</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The softening into skills teach the mind relaxation, non reactivity, non participation in experience of any kind without removing the experience, without averting the gaze, without rejecting experience, without pushing it away. This skill is crucial in learning how to interrupt the chain of dependent origination as well as to decondition the emotional charge associated with memories and ongoing events ….

<h2>Insight into Anatma<a class="headerlink" href="#insight-into-anatma" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The mind wants to live, to survive … and thrive, and believes that it needs an identity, a ‘self’ for the sake of survival. It needs a ‘me’ and the rest of the world clearly demarcated in order to navigate life. And survival perhaps actually requires this ‘me’ … this ‘self’. When ‘I’ am hungry I need to feed ‘me’ … feeding stray cats out of compassion doesn’t help! So I need to know where ‘I’ begin and end. To assist its own drive for survival the mind constructs a self and assigns its goals and objectives as if they were in the service of this self, and attributes its myriad choices, faculties and activities to this self. It doesn’t bother looking at its own creation as a creation, it believes that the self is the doer whereas the self is just one of the things that get done. And it gets done because a place holder is required, to manipulate objects, a subject is required. In order to act, an actor is required. To assign agency, an agent is required. Its a placeholder, post-it note stuck on top of phenomena - saying - ‘This is me’</p>
<p>The insight into Anatma is not about stopping the creation of a self. There is no need to stop creating a self, there is no need to wish it away or wish that it would stay. We gain knowledge of how the mind constructs the sense of self, through that we gain wisdom to manage the mind as it interacts with the world, from that wisdom emerges a cooling down of passion. We no longer feel compelled to take up cudgels, to procure or to fight, against sense impressions, objects, events, people, life circumstances. Thus we operate from ‘Bodhi’ - rationality supported by experiential lived wisdom rather than habituated patterns of challenging, attacking, defending, kicking and punching against sense impressions, objects, people, life circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise - 1 - Manipulate breathing and observe mental states</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>In meditation notice the state of your mind when you first sit - its beneficial to bring in variety in terms of time of the day, daily schedule, after exciting/disappointing events etc</p></li>
<li><p>Practice softening into breathing - slow deep abdominal breathing. Initially intentional and later automatic - making corrections only if breathing shifts to shallow chest breathing</p></li>
<li><p>As you do this from time to time keep checking the general state of your mind, initially with attention moving to the mind and eventually using MIA or the bidirectional arrow of attention</p></li>
<li><p>Simply watch mental states changing - try not to participate in the thinking process</p></li>
<li><p>Interrupt the relaxation that follows (if it does) by bringing to mind a harsh memory (nothing too harsh) - notice the change in mental state</p></li>
<li><p>‘Soften into’ the memory using slow deep abdominal breaths - notice the mental state changing</p></li>
<li><p>The exercise reveals the automaton nature of ‘The Mind’</p></li>
<li><p>The realization arises that - We don’t own our mental states - sink your awareness deeply into this realization. This realization is a cognitive event - just like a thought, a slap in the face, or a caress on the cheek. Hold this realization in smriti as long as it stays and then go back to the exercise</p></li>
<li><p>Rinse, Repeat</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise - 2 - Participation in the mundane-ness of daily life</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Look at your living room, where your nasty little brats have strewn toys and lego bricks all around</p></li>
<li><p>Contemplate the fact that the next 20 minutes are going to be spent on this! Marinate in the horribleness of it all !!!</p></li>
<li><p>Go about doing what you need to do, taking slow gentle softening breaths</p></li>
<li><p>The mind pulls into the posture of ‘I am doing this!’ … ‘I don’t like this!’ … ‘I will make them pay!’</p></li>
<li><p>Use the softening breath to release the mind from this posture</p></li>
<li><p>Repetition of this and similar exercises leads to getting better at releasing the mind from hard postures</p></li>
<li><p>The realization arises that the ferocity, of ‘I am doing this’, isn’t required to get stuff done</p></li>
<li><p>As many times as this realization arises, sink awareness into this realization</p></li>
<li><p>Bring this to as many daily activities as you can</p></li>
<li><p>Doer-ship isn’t needed in any activity really, the more life circumstances in which this realization arises, the more solidity this insight gets</p></li>
<li><p>The mind will fight to get into its habituated postures, keep relaxing, keep softening into, keep putting down the sense of doer-ship</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise - 3 - Attention moves</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Take 3-5 deep abdominal softening breaths gently sighing on the outbreath</p></li>
<li><p>Become aware of sounds - initially that there is a soundscape - then start tracking individual sounds</p></li>
<li><p>Bring awareness to the felt sense of the body, the sense of touch, heaviness, etc</p></li>
<li><p>Put one hand in the other and gently place awareness on the touch of the hands - hardness, friction, temperature</p></li>
<li><p>Soften into and relax the grip of attention - taking less and less interest in the touch of your hands - stay like that</p></li>
<li><p>While staying very mindful of where attention is - in the moment</p></li>
<li><p>Attention will move from the touch of the hands to various other sense doors</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t take any interest in where attention has moved, take a lot of interest in the fact that it has moved</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that attention has moved is ‘known’, this knowing is a cognitive event - be deeply aware of this event, sink awareness into this event, hold it in smriti briefly</p></li>
<li><p>Bring attention back to the touch of the hands and wait for the next movement</p></li>
<li><p>Each time attention moves make it a recognition that you sink attention into - initially use a label - moved, moved, moved, moved - then drop the label entirely</p></li>
<li><p>After a while don’t use an anchor - the touch of the hands - simply allow attention move freely - deeply noticing that it moves, and that you did not choose to move it</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise - 4 - Effortless concentration</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Choose a challenging concentration rule set - TMI is fantastic</p></li>
<li><p>At any point of development where ever you are on the progression map - understand the instructions that are needed to be executed - TMI is fantastic</p></li>
<li><p>Jot down the instructions in your own words - sharp crisp bullet points</p></li>
<li><p>Memorize the instructions - know them like the back of your hand - visualize / imagine yourself executing those instructions again and again until they are imbedded in memory</p></li>
<li><p>On the cushion simply bring those instructions to smriti, sati, mindfulness, and permit the mind to execute those instructions</p></li>
<li><p>Every time ‘you’ lay a claim of ownership on the execution of those instructions - take deep softening breaths and relax, put down the sense of ownership</p></li>
<li><p>Initially you will feel like a prompter in a play, standing in the wings helping characters who forget their lines, or a cheerleader waving pompoms as the athletes play</p></li>
<li><p>Soften into this role as well - put down this role - you aren’t required!</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The ferocity of ‘I am doing this’ is an afterthought, an assignment of volition, and is completely redundant - but mostly harmless - initially. As concentration practice progresses, as TMI stages move onwards - this ferocity is a problem. I own shamatha, I have cultivated stable attention, Ekagrata is mine! me! me! me! this in and by itself is what prevents shamatha from flowering. This is also the reason why shamatha does not rebuild after a collapse. TMI tries to address this in stage 7 - but in this style of practice, which I suggest here, stage 7 is intermingled with all stages - right from the first sit onwards to stage 10, onwards to the jhanas, onwards to nirodha sampatti. When such a style of practice is adopted it feels very very strange like an ill fitting shoe. But that is only due to habituation towards the ferocity of ‘I am doing this’. Once this style becomes the new norm - shamatha flowers rapidly - firmly establishing the self driving nature of the mind - where the sense of self is sitting behind a fake steering wheel pretending to drive. To assist in this style of practice one way of framing an approach is to simply set aside each and every goal and get concerned with the process, then to simply set aside the process and get concerned with the steps, then to simply set aside concern with the steps and let the mind handle it.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 5 - Cetana / intentions in walking meditation and in daily life</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Start walking</p></li>
<li><p>Begin by taking a lot of interest in the soles of your feet</p></li>
<li><p>Increase the scope of interest up to the ankles</p></li>
<li><p>From ankles to knees to hips to neck to both arms to head - in stages, while walking</p></li>
<li><p>Include sounds</p></li>
<li><p>Include vision</p></li>
<li><p>Include mind</p></li>
<li><p>Stay with this configuration - aware of the entirety of conscious experience - permitting attention to go where it gets pulled</p></li>
<li><p>Slowly in steps, exclude everything except mind and feet</p></li>
<li><p>Against each movement of the feet - can you find the cetana / intention to lift, move, place down, push - lift, move, place down, push - lift, move, place down, push</p></li>
<li><p>To have a good sense of what intentions are you can do the exercise of softening into intentions. This is a softening into exercise but can be repurposed to familiarize the mind with what precisely an intention is thereby helping the mind look for intentions behind other stuff</p></li>
<li><p>This exercise is fairly challenging, but once intentions can be isolated, they will show up like crystal clear ‘objects’ which you can be aware of - moving the body in a specific way</p></li>
<li><p>This sensitivity can be carried to any task in daily life that is kind of repetitive and doesn’t involve a lot of intentional thinking - washing dishes for example</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly seeing the chain of intentions as driving the show behind many of the common place actions that we perform shakes loose the sense of doer-ship</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise 6 - The post-it note</strong></p>
<p>Develop sensitivity to thoughts and the thinking process. Learn to fully engage and categorize thoughts in 2 categorization schemas - (1) visual, auditory, meaning based (2) random, habitual, driven by emotional charge, narration, deliberate. This nature of work with thinking may initially involve engagement with thinking at the layer of form but has to move on to the layer of content as well. You need to develop the ability to know you are thinking in a particular way as well as the content of that which you are thinking. The robustness of smriti ensures that you remember ‘I am just sitting here’ … and not get pulled into the ‘story’ thereby losing the ability to investigate, categorize.</p>
<p>The post-it note is a meaning based thinking that is continuously narrating what it is that you are doing. ‘I am meditating’, ‘I am paying attention to the breath’, ‘I am paying attention to the itch on my left butt cheek’, ‘I am here … and there is the object’, ‘I am getting calmer’. This meaning based narration materializes around the most salient thing that is happening - In meditation or in daily life. This is the ‘Post-it note’. It is very very tricky - If you look mindfully at the post-it note it unhooks from its current location and attaches itself to a set of phenomena associated with the act of looking. It can also be deliberately ripped off and slapped on to other stuff - with some degree of skill.</p>
<p>This post-it note can be ‘softened into’. It can be attenuated in its strength. It ‘blinks’. The first couple of times it blinks - it is spectacular - all of reality / conscious experience may blink with it! Even if that doesn’t happen, the kind of sensitivity developed to the construction, ripping off and sticking elsewhere, blinking - of this post-it note makes some very interesting things happen. Sitting on the couch doing nothing - it blinks in and out - and ‘you’ can be aware of this blinking. Often for extended durations you may find that you don’t have this post-it note - and it materializes when somebody comes to talk to you, or a memory pops up which requires a clear demarcation of ‘Here I am’ and ‘There is the problem’.</p>

<h2>Concluding comments<a class="headerlink" href="#concluding-comments" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>I am not a psychologist, I have a direct experience of depression, anxiety, panic attacks. I also have direct experience of meditative progress and freedom from defilements. I know nothing about any other kind of mental health problem. Terms like De-personalization - are like ancient Latin or Greek for me. I advice caution and the highest standards of looking out for one’s safety and interest in engaging with any of this material!!</p></li>
<li><p>Awakening practices are not a book reading game. It is a game of sets and reps. They say awakening is an accident. Well sure … it is an accident in the same way that pregnancy is an accident. A couple may do what is needed for months and years and not be blessed with a baby. But nobody … absolutely nobody in the history of humanity has slammed into a member of the opposite sex while walking on the pavement and looking at their phone, and gotten blessed with a bouncy little baby. Nobody has read a book, or genuflected in front of a cross or prostrated in front of an idol of the goddess of fertility and been blessed with a bouncy little baby - without doing the actual work. Sets and Reps, In and Out … no other way!</p></li>
<li><p>These sets and reps they get very repetitive, and if you do them because - you want awakening! you must have awakening! … Well this is exactly like love making for the exclusive purpose of getting pregnant. Very quickly it gets mechanical, frustrating … and you can’t keep it up. The sets and reps have to be done for their own sake. Take joy in the cultivation of skill and be deeply curious about all the sets and reps and how they work and the results they have in the here and now. Get good at the practice itself, take joy in the practice itself, make the lovemaking the core objective … the ‘results’ will take care of themselves. To see the execution of the process as a passionate hobby than to see it as a mechanism of getting results is how effort can be sustained and leads to success without burnout. In Indic languages this attitude is called ‘chhanda’ - being passionate about something for its own sake. It is an attitude that has to be cultivated, curated, and guarded like a hawk. One needs to have the chhanda of making sweet sweet love!</p></li>

<p>Next post will be about the dukkha nanas and how to work with them in greater detail than I had written in a previous post on the topic. Thanks a lot for reading. All comments are welcome. Those that come from direct experience or the aspiration for direct experience will be greeted with a gregarious bear-hug and Jager bombs. Those that come from textual scholarship will be given a very very tentative, perhaps patronizing but mostly encouraging side-hug.</p>
