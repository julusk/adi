<span id="log"></span><h1>Creating and maintaining a log of formal meditation sessions<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-and-maintaining-a-log-of-formal-meditation-sessions" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>I have a very methodical mindset and I know that it doesn’t suit everybody. But there’s one formal meditation adjacent activity that has helped me a lot and I felt I could share it in case somebody else finds it useful. Basically very early on I started to log my sits.</p>
<p>To over-simplify, I was working with a set of instructions which involved broadly creating different structures of awareness and then being very curious about what happened next while soothing the citta - the heart-mind. Within this over-simplified way of looking at practice - in any meditation session there were clear attention/awareness skills, soothing, relaxation, softening into skills, curiosity and investigation skills being trained and there were outcomes of those skills in terms of some degree of understanding that emerged.</p>
<p><strong>Writing a log:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Understand the instructions and memorize them</p></li>
<li><p>Get a sense of what the objective is of this practice - what’s the skill development arc and what kind of results can you expect over a period of time. Your understanding of this will evolve over a period of time as you engage with the instructions, but even without direct experience we still do have some rough idea</p></li>
<li><p>Initially against instructions simply record whether you could do the instructions during the flow of the sit</p></li>
<li><p>To do the above requires sati-sampajanna, mindfulness with clear comprehension, robust working memory with powerful metacognitive awareness. conversely when we place a demand on ourselves of logging our sits, we are now encouraged by that demand to exercise the sati-sampajanna muscles. Thus its a positive feedback loop.</p></li>
<li><p>As ability to be metacognitively observant and then remember what happened during the sit increases, bring in more detail in terms of the results of following the instructions. What happened in terms of perception - could you structure awareness the way you were supposed to. What happened in terms of cognition - the quality of thoughts and attitudes that get triggered by the perceptual exercises and what happened in terms of affect - the movements of the citta, the heart, the heart-mind</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Benefits of keeping a meditation log:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Promote sati-sampajanna (mindfulness with clear comprehension / short term working memory with MIA). To execute meditation instructions and simply keep a record of how the sit went vis a vis the meditation instructions is a superimposed requirement that requires the yogi to remember the instructions, remember whether they were able to execute the instructions, remember the results of executing the meditation instructions - doable, difficult, not doable etc. Its all about memory and clear comprehension of what happens in ‘the mind’ during the course of the meditation</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluation and planning. To meditate in a given session with a goal/objective, to do multiple meditation sessions in the form a larger campaign to achieve a goal requires a basis for evaluation of individual meditations and trend across meditation sessions. A goal could be …. ‘I want to get concentrated’ or …. ‘I want to learn how to release the mind from anxiety’ … or a more ambitious goal could be ‘I want to attain the 275th jhana’ …. ‘I want to use the breath nimitta to learn how to levitate’ :) :) … I am joking …. a log will develop a clear picture of how the instructions are being executed and whether they are leading in a direction of skill building as planned. A log over a period of time exposes skill gaps, strengths and weaknesses. So it helps evaluate a block of time - say 2 weeks and it helps to plan for the next block of time say a subsequent 2 weeks for eg.</p></li>
<li><p>Doubt. A log and associated evaluation and further planning facilitates a yogi to address doubt. Am I making progress, am I stalled, is this the right meditation style for me, is this working for me .. any and every question that may pester a yogi can be sequestered into a half an hour session every 2 weeks where raw data in the log can be used to form an opinion, larger time frame progress can be viewed and any recency bias can be avoided. A yogi may have decided to pick up ‘softening into’ for example. A log crisply written, evaluation and planning done every two weeks and a larger scale review done once every two months of the progress made will reveal whether ‘softening into’ is working as designed for the yogi or not, and whether any technique changes is required. Vicikicca or doubt is simply devalued by cold hard data</p></li>
<li><p>Skillfully devalue the story of the yogi, and start valuing the story of ‘the mind’ doing bhavana or cultivation of skill. Over a period of time a log can get really technical. As sati-sampajanna increases a yogi may start logging simple observations of what style of meditation they did in a particular session and what happens in <strong>Perception, Cognition, Affect</strong>. That’s it. Grounding the practice in the story of the cultivation rather than the story of the yogi. along with this the regular evaluation and planning sessions will keep giving the part of the mind that wants to express its individuality and humanity a chance to express itself against the hard data in front of it. ‘I am a success!!!’ ‘I am a failed yogi!!!’ …. OK fine what does the data say?</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Funny story</strong></p>
<p>I remember either reading or listening to the story of a Burmese meditation master and Sayadaw. I don’t remember the names or the source of this story, but its very pertinent.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a meditation retreat, the Sayadaw would give clear crisp instructions to the retreat participants and then simply take regular meditation interviews. In any interview the Sayadaw would only ask … what happened during the meditation session? what happened next? ok, what else happened? Any interviewee would answer this question a couple of times and then simply say … ‘I don’t remember’. The Sayadaw would give very pointed feedback …… ‘Please try to remember’ and then simply send the yogi on his way.</p>
<p>What he was attempting to do was to establish the importance of being mindful and clearly comprehending during the meditation session. As frustrating as this may have been to the retreat participants, the approach is actually solid. The meditation log is like the Sayadaw. All it wants to know is …… ‘What else happened’ … and on the cushion you are not supposed to frame the log, that is not a part of the instructions! :)</p>
<p>Hope this us useful</p>
