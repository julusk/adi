<p>A friend of mine wanted to know how I experience cessation versus nirodha sampatti in order to inform their own practice. To create a meaningful comparison between these two attainments and the direct experience of what they feel like and deliver, it is important to create a context of how they are approached, thus there is a build up to the comparison. I am sharing it here in case it helps anybody else. Whatever I write, I write from direct experience. I use language created by other people but that is a mere convenience since it saves me time from cooking up new lingo.</p>

<h2>Cessation in the Progress of Insight<a class="headerlink" href="#cessation-in-the-progress-of-insight" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>In doing the practice of investigation within the 4 foundations of mindfulness, the yogi starts to track objects from the point of inception onwards to the point of extinction. Initially clumsily, and then with skill and confidence. The yogi knows the object, knows the sense door where it comes from and how the object and its knowing is different for different objects and their knowing. Within the 3 foundations of mindfulness the yogi through tracking and knowing objects has already developed a lot of familiarity with objects, categories of objects, and the sense doors. The yogi has done a lot of juxtaposition between objects, between categories, between sense doors. The yogi has seen linkages or specific conditionality between objects and categories through seeing precedents and consequences.</p>
<p>This relentless object tracking naturally leads to the tracking of characteristics of objects. Awareness of sound naturally leads to the characteristics of sound like shrillness, volume, tonality. Awareness of body sensations naturally leads to the characteristics of body sensations like heat, coolness, friction, hardness, smoothness, stability, movement etc. This switch from object to characteristics of objects leads to a engagement of awareness with universal characteristics which are common to objects across categories and sense doors. Awareness starts to engage with the characteristic of impermanence. Impermanence fully experientially understood is the insight into Emptiness (or Shunyata). Nothing exists as far as the mind is concerned. The mind creates the world and it imputes meaning into the world. Minute by minute, moment by moment the world collapses and then is recreated. Meaning is seen to be given to the world rather than the world carrying any meaning by itself. From the impermanent characteristic of objects the mind switches to the characteristic of the interplay between perception and apperception. This leads to the insight into Unreliability (or Anitya/Anicca). The mind has a-priori assumptions about how stuff works. It has models regarding how stuff works and those models do not conform to what it has now learnt. The mind naturally experiences a cognitive friction which at first presents itself as fear.</p>
<p>The mind meets ‘objects’ with awareness gripping them in a certain way. There are four such grips to be relaxed one by one. Conventional experience and language helps us here in describing these grips as Expectation, Dislike, Rejection, Separation. These descriptions of the grips in conventional language can only act as a vector to help us find them and release them. Standalone the dictionary meaning and its linguistic and conceptual understanding doesn’t help. These words are pointers.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>I expect things to be a certain way - when we totally relax this grip - the mind lets go of fear and experiences misery</p></li>
<li><p>I dislike what is happening - when we totally relax this grip - the mind lets go of misery and experiences disgust</p></li>
<li><p>I reject what is happening - when we totally relax this grip - the mind lets go of disgust and experiences desperation to get out of here</p></li>
<li><p>I am separate from what is happening - when we totally relax this grip - the mind lets go of desperation to get out and then enters into complete acceptance and equanimity</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Each and every nana on the PoI map is like setting a chain of dominoes falling - the dukkha nanas and what the mind learns and therefore does within dukkha nanas to move past them is required to explain the cessation event. At the end of the Dukkha nanas - there is no yogi, no meditator. The yogi identity, the fiction of an entity who is doing the meditation is a construct. A construct that is supported by its raw materials:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>There is a right to hold expectations - that’s why there is an ‘I’,</p></li>
<li><p>There is right to say ‘This is preferable, its likeable, this is not preferable its unlikeable’ - that’s why there an ‘I’</p></li>
<li><p>There is a right to pass judgement and say ‘this is rejected, that is accepted’ - that’s why there is an ‘I’</p></li>
<li><p>There is a right to demarcate ‘This is me, its mine and that is not me, its not mine’ - That’s why there is an ‘I’</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Our understanding as it emerges from conventional / relative reality of this relative world is that there is an entity and therefore there are mental positions. Our understanding of the absolute world where the interplay between perception and apperception creates the world is that there are mental positions these mental positions lead to the creation of an entity and not the other way around.</p>
<p>In equanimity the yogi is no longer doing the yog, ‘The Mind’ is doing the yog and ‘The Mind’ sees the entity as just one more object. In the absence of the grips or the mental positions the entity is now just an object that enters through the sense door of the mind, and fluctuates and blinks. The meditating mind recognizes its fallacy and totally relaxes its participation in that which it has habitually done and dumps - everything. This is a cessation - it solidifies all the knowledges that has come before and an exit from the cessation is accompanied by a tremendous relief.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Objects change</p></li>
<li><p>Objects are unreliable</p></li>
<li><p>If unreliable objects are met with sticky grips then there will be friction</p></li>
<li><p>The mind lets go of sticky grips and then there is no friction</p></li>
<li><p>The mind discovers that ‘I’ emerges from these sticky grips and in their absence it is just a marker, a place holder, just one more object like a random thought of pizza</p></li>
<li><p>The mind dumps everything</p></li>
<li><p>Awareness is now completely un populated by any object</p></li>
<li><p>A cessation is chock full of awareness - it is most certainly not a state of general anesthesia</p></li>
<li><p>A return of injection of objects in this unpolluted awareness is accompanied by a tremendous amount of relief</p></li>
<li><p>The mind does a quick check of all the grips it has abandoned and all the sticky grips that are still left</p></li>

<h2>Nirodha Sampatti through the practice of Nirvikalpa samadhi<a class="headerlink" href="#nirodha-sampatti-through-the-practice-of-nirvikalpa-samadhi" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>A detailed overview of what this practice is is written <a class="reference internal" href="nirvikalpa.html#nirvikalpa"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a>. I wont go into the details.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Awareness keeps engaging with objects and selects one notional object to create a subject</p></li>
<li><p>The exercise of softening into objects leads to Awareness losing the momentum of selecting objects</p></li>
<li><p>The exercise of softening into the tendency to objectify leads to Awareness no longer selecting any object at all</p></li>
<li><p>This is a state where awareness contains all objects - but there is no subject. This is partially mature nirvikalpa samadhi. It is comparable to equanimity or sankharupekkha nana from the PoI</p></li>
<li><p>The difference between the two modes of practice lies in a quality of investigation in the PoI progression and a quality of renunciation in the Nirvikalpa samadhi practice</p></li>
<li><p>Awareness drops all objects and takes itself as an object - this is fully mature nirvikalpa samadhi</p></li>
<li><p>At this point further softening into the desire to objectify awareness leads to awareness dropping itself as the object - Phenomenologically this is precisely the same experience as that of cessation in the PoI</p></li>
<li><p>Completely unpolluted awareness unengaged with anything as an object - not even itself</p></li>
<li><p>This is not even comparable to general anesthesia - OK I shouldn’t be saying this, I have never experienced general anesthesia - This is not a gap in experience - this is a better statement :) :)</p></li>
<li><p>This state can be maintained for very lengthy periods of time simply by forming a Sankalp or firm resolve at the beginning of the session to stay in this state for a defined period of time</p></li>
<li><p>In this practice wisdom or specific conditionality is missing. The quality of renunciation leads to the abandoning of objectification therefore halting the creation of a subject or an ‘I’</p></li>

<section id="commonalities-between-the-two-styles-of-practice">
<h2>Commonalities between the two styles of practice<a class="headerlink" href="#commonalities-between-the-two-styles-of-practice" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Partially mature Nirvikalpa Samadhi is deeply healing. All the day’s events that might be cognitively heavy are processed and released, past traumas simply come up are acknowledged and released, there is no ‘I’ to interfere and hold on to a story or create a new story, a new trauma out of this processing. The state of equanimity in PoI has attention and preference for object, but the sense of self is also taken as an object .. again and again. Equanimity too is healing and feels rejuvenating but it is not even comparable in its power to rejuvenate like Nirvikalpa samadhi. Doing partially mature Nirvikalpa Samadhi alone without even letting it mature fully and doing Nirodha Sampatti is a very very valuable exercise for healing the psyche</p></li>
<li><p>Cessation in the PoI is exactly like Nirodha Sampatti. Awareness without any object projected into it, awareness not even taking itself as an object. It is the one time in our lives when we are deeply deeply aware</p></li>
<li><p>Duration control is very easy in Nirodha Sampatti. Nirodha Sampatti is approached as a renunciation practice. This is not renunciation of a lamborghini and fetishization of a begging bowl. This is renunciation of the act of being an entity, the act of choosing objects, the act of having objects at all in awareness. Thus practiced regularly it becomes a quality of mind. Whereas in Cessation attainment there is always some amount of uncertainty at least for me, and I simply never could control duration … ever</p></li>
