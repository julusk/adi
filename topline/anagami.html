<p>A dear friend of mine is currently working on the path to Anagami attainment. These are notes that I am writing for him as a ready reckoner to refer to. Due to these being notes rather than detailed instructions, they are brief and to the point. I hope this is of help to someone out there reading this.</p>

<p>As part of a curriculum we have worked through many of these exercises.</p>
<p><strong>The mind is dumb!</strong></p>
<p>Had the mind been smart, it would have freed itself in the many decades that we have lived. We take cognizance of the fact that the mind is dumb and we create practice plans structured around operating principles worked out by the yogis that have come before us which in turn can be traced back to the general principles taught by Uncle Sid. In the months that we have worked together you have applied yourself at many of these exercises. But I am jotting them down here because these exercises that got us to shrotapanna are the very building blocks of mental training and the skills they afford to the mind keep deteriorating thus we keep returning to these exercises as and when required. Often we return to them just to diagnose our current skill level and then we continue doing them in order to keep these foundational skills alive.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Using a chosen well defined object to tether the mind to and develop each and every one of the factors of awakening</p></li>
<li><p>Doing the above exercise with a sankalpa or a resolve to work upon specific factors of awakening. You should be able to access each of the factors of awakening and dial them up or down as if you were turning dials. For example choose to establish mindfulness and simply work on amping up tranquility balanced with energy. Doing such an exercise inclines the mind to readily access these factors of awakening. In a similar way you can choose to focus on concentration and investigation or equanimity and joy.</p></li>
<li><p>Doing the jhanas is not readily possible for everyone but if the mind as it presents in our specific individual case is inclined towards absorption then it is beneficial to learn the formed jhanas at a bare minimum and practice getting really flexible with the formed jhanas - work up and down the jhanic arc, jump around in the jhana sequence, take a deep breath and simply enter the jhana of your choice</p></li>
<li><p>Familiarity, juxtaposition, precedents and consequents with the sense doors - here we use categorization rubrics in order to apprehend, sort and categorize phenomena. read more <a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Arhatship/comments/rqbtx0/discussion_thread_28_dec_2021/hyr6yne/?context-3">here</a></p></li>
<li><p>Establish mindfulness in a grounding object and do anatta practice. Attention moves on its own, attention reaches out to a sense door on its own, attention lands on an object on its own, attention tracks the object and the object ‘changes’ on its own, objects have life cycles independent of what we want from them.

<h2>The exercises that lead to Anagami (Sakrdagami on the way)<a class="headerlink" href="#the-exercises-that-lead-to-anagami-sakrdagami-on-the-way" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Copy pasting this from a post that I had written on discord. Some context is lost.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Here’s how DO works Lets take it from contact onwards Through out your life before that itch showed up this has happened: Avijja (ignorance) - Samskara (constructs that construct experience) - vijnana (consciousness actively moulded by samskara) Because you were ignorant, therefore you kept taking intentional actions that created and embedded samskara or constructs that construct experience. These are like terminate and stay resident programs, or apps in the background, simply waiting to be called into action. Awareness - the pure potentiality of knowing is now coloured/conditioned to bend into specific grips, postures in response to specific contacts. This is all in the past - birth after birth after birth - you have been doing karma that create or strengthen these sankharas. A statement like - I will never let a bully walk away without bloodying his nose otherwise tomorrow he will bring his pals for a repeat performance - this is a construct / samskara - it is preverbal and preconceptual and simply waiting to be ‘called’. Upto this point there is nothing for a yogi to do by way of technique On the day that you meditate Contact (sparsh) - feeling tone (vedana) - thirst (trishna) - followed by the usual mess Itch - negative vedana - urge to act - the process and final product of a human being that now has to scratch his ass but cant because he is sitting in a meditation retreat hall</p></li>
<li><p>Regarding contact Anything that the mind can take as its object is a contact An itch is a contact, I am irritated and meditating and there is an itch on my ass and I am about to let out a loud burp is a contact, The negative vedana of the itch once taken as an object is also a contact Simple contact, compound contact - lots of scope for what constitutes contact when you meditate In our example: I am irritated and an itch showed up on my ass is the contact - this has negative vedana I won the lottery, the winning ticket is in my pocket and an itch showed up on my ass can be an alternate contact - this might have a positive vedana (we dont know) Regarding the chain of DO To learn the concept and to start investigating it makes a lot of sense to talk of a chain of events each ‘causing’ the other. A logically connected causal chain. But further scrutiny and experience in tracking specific conditionality in general and DO in particular will show that it is not a chain and it has nothing to do with causality. Because there is a hole in the ground, therefore there is a foundation, therefore there is a ground floor, therefore there is a first floor … and so on …. therefore consciousness in all of its potentiality has a whole landscape populated with sky scrapers. The salient point is that the hole in the ground <strong>does not cause</strong> the foundation, the foundation <strong>does not cause</strong> the first floor etc. The human sits on top of the sky scraper. Depending on salience of contact - one particular sky scraper manifests itself with a fully formed human being on top, contemplating suicide :) (I mean this as a joke). Our moment by moment conscious experience is a fully formed human atop a sky scraper. The sky scraper and therefore the human keeps changing - moment by moment. Continuity is an illusion What defines which skyscraper and which human in any given moment depends on the vedana or charge of any particular contact - and remember that contact is not a simplistic thing</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Practice philosophy:</strong></p>
<p>When we meditate on objects using mahasi noting for example with sounds for example, something naturally happens: 1. The mind notes - fart sound, bird tweet, door slam, keyboard clacket, flute music 2. The mind starts taking sound specific characteristics and notes them - hard, soft, loud, cacophonous, pulse, continuous, etc 3. The mind starts taking object specific characteristics - start, fluctuation, end Either this happens using the brute force noting method or the yogi has to be given exercises with specific instructions that can induce this In understanding specific conditionality and DO - we are talking about a level of talent which is very rare for this to naturally happen. Either this talent exists or we have to give/do exercises to induce the mind to take skyscrapers as objects so that it can then start recognizing foundation, ground floor, first floor etc</p>
<p><strong>Preparation:</strong></p>
<p>List down 4 to 5 memories that carry negative vedana (negative vedana is good because it creates the salience that is required to permit a skyscraper to form - as per plan and intentionality). This can be done with positive vedana memories but … difficult. List down 4 to 5 meaning carrying phrases that mean something to you. eg: I am being attacked, I am being humiliated, I am being criticised, There is a pandemic, The republicans will win the next election etc etc - remember that these things have to be salient but don’t traumatize yourself</p>
<p><strong>The method:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Generate momentum in mindfulness, relaxation, energy, concentration and investigation - do a practice that you are familiar with</p></li>
<li><p>Forget about equanimity and joy - they will take care of themselves</p></li>
<li><p>In a calm still mind drop the memory, objectify it</p></li>
<li><p>Observe all the results, the discomfort, the stress in the jaw, the heaviness in the gut</p></li>
<li><p>While keeping the memory alive, dropping it in the same ‘place’ again and again - use slow deep abdominal breathing to calm the body and mind</p></li>
<li><p>With each drop of the contact - observe: Contact - Vedana - Trishna - the mess that follows</p></li>
<li><p>You are recreating the same ‘skyscraper’ for the purpose of learning how skyscrapers get constructed</p></li>
<li><p>Using the same memory over and over will lead to a side effect - the vedana of the memory will get cleaved off - the memory is no longer of use to you - move on to other memories, other phrases</p></li>
<li><p>Over a period of time with this exercise you will start noticing two things: Just like mahasi noting moves to characteristics or contours of objects and not its meaning, similarly this exercise will yield familiarity with each floor of the skyscraper - from contact onwards. The second thing you will notice is that each floor of the skyscraper requires effort to maintain - and effort that you didn’t even know existed - This is the house builder - You will smash his rafters</p></li>
<li><p>At contact and vedana start relaxing the mind and body, slow deep abdominal breathing, relax the jaw, drop the eyelids, drop the brow, and sigh at the construction process, literally sigh at it - a silent sigh, no noise</p></li>
<li><p>You will interrupt the housebuilder successfully at vedana - once! and if you are fully present and metacognitively aware then once is enough, on demand you can interrupt him - Sakrdagami</p></li>
<li><p>Now permit some skyscraper to get created, interrupt others - move to open monitoring and noting of whatever … randomly permit dukkha and randomly interrupt it, the mind learns not to encourage the housebuilder any more - Anagami</p></li>
<li><p>Bullet points 11, 12 take a lot of time to get to. Time and regular diligent practice.</p></li>

<p>The progress of insight map and the way it plays out is a direct result of practicing a certain way. Heavy doses of momentary concentration practice done for hours every day over months in a retreat like setting will probably lead to insights arising in the precise way that they are described in the PoI map. If we don’t practice like that, and we arent - we are doing a lot of shamatha practice and we are establishing ourselves in anatta then the gaining of insights will not necessarily follow the PoI map. but the PoI map is still relevant for us.</p>
<p>Consider the map and its sixteen stages and the learnings from each stage and start clubbing together insights into categories. We see that insight happens across 4 different categories:</p>
<blockquote>

<li><p>Emptiness - this is an insight into the construct nature of our conscious experience. Conscious experience is constructed, it is assembled. An apple is an apple because the mind uses raw sensory data and constructs an apple. a friend is a friend because the mind imputes the meaning ‘friend’. Love, friendship, hate, adversariness - everything is a construct. Basically we ‘live’ or we take ‘birth’ moment by moment in worlds that are constructed by the mind</p></li>
<li><p>Unreliability - Due to the construct nature of our conscious experience, absolutely nothing can be relied upon to last. Nationality, relationships, love, devotion, jobs, wages, economy - everything is unreliable</p></li>
<li><p>Anatma - the sense of self that we carry around inside us it too is a construct of the mind. The mind uses the sensory information that it receives through the 6 senses and creates a sense of self that is born moment by moment in newer worlds - continuity is a sticky illusion. This does not mean that their is no self - it means only that what we are conscious of , what we are aware of is a hologram that is constructed and refreshed sense contact by sense contact</p></li>
<li><p>Dukkha - we are ignorant of the above three things and have spent a lifetime perfecting the results of our ignorance. the results being the way in which the mind meets its objects, the way in which awareness engages with objects, the grips of expectations, dislike, rejection, seperation</p></li>

<p><strong>But but but …. I am a sakadagami! .. why am I experiencing dukkha</strong></p>
<p>This path is all about dukkha and dukkha nirodha. we don’t need to practice the mahasi way in order to trigger or induce dukkha. It already exists. We are doing this entire project to be free of dukkha.</p>
<p>We do not do this to understand emptiness - who cares!</p>
<p>Appreciate unreliability - fuck that shit!</p>
<p>Revel in not-self - pffffffftttt!</p>
<p>Dukkha is what we are trying to understand and be free of. All the knowledge we gain regarding the other insight categories is really in the service of being free of dukkha.</p>
<p>All those many years ago when you came to meditation, I am presuming that you did not come due to mysticism and interest in the mystical world, what brought you, and me, to this craft is … dukkha.3rd path for me, and for a lot of people would be my guess is where you go toe to toe with this particular problem.</p>
<p>We are tremendously entrenched in the story of our lives, but when we reach this territory we need to get aligned with the story of the mind. Learn that dukkha arises due to the ‘grips’ and learn to let go of those grips. The sooner the association is made between the affective outcomes of fear, misery, disgust and desperation with the ways in which the mind meets objects (as opposed to looking at the ‘story’) the sooner we learn what dukkha is and we conquer it experientially.</p>
